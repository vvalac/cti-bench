   The use of batch scripts to deploy OpenSSH binaries renamed as RuntimeBroker.exe, establishing persistence via registry run keys, and harvesting credentials via PowerShell scripts aligns with LockBit’s known post-exploitation toolset and techniques.

4. **Lateral Movement Using Impacket and Cobalt Strike**:  
   The deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons via DLL side-loading (7zG.exe and 7z.DLL) and lateral movement using Impacket tools is a common LockBit tactic. LockBit affiliates frequently use Cobalt Strike for internal reconnaissance and lateral movement.

5. **Indicators of Compromise and Infrastructure**:  
   The report mentions that the IOCs and infrastructure (e.g., NetSupport RAT configuration domains) have been previously linked to the [PLACEHOLDER] ransomware group. Given the described TTPs and the fact that Rapid7 associates these IOCs with a ransomware group known for these behaviors, LockBit is the most probable candidate.

6. **Absence of Ransomware Deployment in Observed Cases**:  
   LockBit operators often conduct reconnaissance and credential harvesting before deploying ransomware. The absence of ransomware in these cases is consistent with early-stage intrusion activity or testing phases observed in LockBit campaigns.

### Summary:

- Social engineering via spam + phone calls impersonating IT  
- Abuse of legitimate RMM tools (AnyDesk, Quick Assist, NetSupport, ScreenConnect)  
- Use of batch scripts for persistence and credential theft  
- Lateral movement with Impacket and Cobalt Strike DLL side-loading  
- IOCs linked to a known ransomware group with these TTPs  
- Rapid7’s internal and OSINT linkages to the [PLACEHOLDER] ransomware group  

**All these strongly point to the LockBit ransomware group as the responsible threat actor.**
