Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there is a use-after-free in cec_queue_msg_fh, related to drivers/media/cec/core/cec-adap.c and drivers/media/cec/core/cec-api.c.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type:** Use-after-free vulnerability  
- **Component:** Linux kernel media subsystem (CEC - Consumer Electronics Control)  
- **Affected versions:** Linux kernel through 6.7.1  
- **Impact:** Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing code execution or denial of service.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically in the media subsystem.  
- Typically, kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited locally or remotely depending on the interface.  
- CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) is related to HDMI and media devices, which usually require local access or physical proximity.  
- However, since this is a kernel driver, exploitation likely requires local access (e.g., local user or process).  
- **AV = Local (L)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Use-after-free vulnerabilities often require specific conditions to trigger.  
- However, if the vulnerability is straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained, AC is Low.  
- No indication of complex conditions or timing attacks.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker likely needs to be a local user with some privileges to interact with the media subsystem.  
- Usually, media device access is available to unprivileged users or users in specific groups (e.g., video group).  
- If the attacker needs no privileges, PR = None; if some privileges are needed, PR = Low.  
- Given typical Linux permissions, likely **PR = Low (L)** (some privileges needed to interact with the device).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does exploitation require user interaction?  
- Usually, kernel vulnerabilities exploited by local users do not require additional user interaction.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- Kernel vulnerabilities usually affect the entire system, so scope is likely Changed (C).  
- Use-after-free in kernel can lead to privilege escalation or system compromise.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure if memory is read.  
- The description does not explicitly mention info disclosure, but use-after-free can cause it.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can allow code execution or modification of data.  
- Assign **High (H)** for integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause system crashes or denial of service.  
- Assign **High (H)** for availability impact.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to exploit kernel driver |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to exploit once local access is obtained |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (e.g., user in video group) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to kernel-level impact |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure via memory corruption |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact (code execution or data modification) |
| A      | H     | High availability impact (system crash/DoS) |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.85

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.151 = 0.849

- Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 * (Impact Subscore - 0.029) - 3.25 * (Impact Subscore - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.849 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.849 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.82 - 3.25 * (0.829)^15  
= 6.17 - 3.25 * 0.087  
= 6.17 - 0.28 = 5.89

- Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.89 + 1.85, 10)) = round_up(7.74) = 7.7

#####2#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: IBM OpenPages with Watson 8.3 and 9.0
- Vulnerability: Weaker than expected security in Native authentication
- Attack scenario: An attacker with access to the OpenPages database can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to other OpenPages accounts.
- Key points:
  - Attacker must have access to the OpenPages database.
  - Exploitation involves a series of specially crafted steps.
  - Result: unauthorized access to other accounts (likely privilege escalation or unauthorized access).

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must have access to the OpenPages database.  
- Access to the database is typically local or adjacent, not over the network.  
- Since the attacker needs database access (likely local or adjacent network), but not physical access, and not just network access, the best fit is **Adjacent (A)** if the database is accessible over a local network, or **Local (L)** if attacker must be on the same host.  
- Usually, database access implies local or adjacent. Since the description does not specify remote network access, and database access is often local, we choose **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- "Through a series of specially crafted steps" suggests some complexity.  
- Not trivial, but not necessarily high complexity.  
- However, the phrase "series of specially crafted steps" implies **High (H)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- "An attacker with access to the OpenPages database" means the attacker already has some level of access.  
- Access to the database implies some privileges, but not necessarily administrative.  
- Since the attacker can access the database, but is not an admin, likely **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of needing another user to do anything.  
- The attacker acts directly on the database.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker gains unauthorized access to other OpenPages accounts.  
- This suggests the impact crosses security boundaries within the product.  
- The vulnerability affects other accounts, so the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unauthorized access to other accounts implies some confidentiality impact.  
- Likely **Low (L)** because the attacker can access other accounts, but no mention of full data disclosure.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Gaining unauthorized access to accounts may allow modification of data.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data modification, but unauthorized access often implies some integrity impact.  
- Assign **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- Assign **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Attacker must have local access to the database.                                          |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Exploitation requires a series of specially crafted steps.                                |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Attacker needs some privileges to access the database, but not admin.                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Unauthorized access to other accounts changes scope.                                      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Unauthorized access to accounts impacts confidentiality at a low level.                   |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible modification or misuse of accounts implies low integrity impact.                  |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact mentioned.                                                         |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 1.31

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 7.52 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

- Base Score (Scope Changed):  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [2.95 + 1.31, 10])  
= Roundup (4.26) = 4.3

#####3#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in MailMunch Constant Contact Forms by MailMunch allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Constant Contact Forms by MailMunch: from n/a through 2.0.11.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Effect:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable over the network (via web requests).  
- **Privileges Required:** Typically none, as the attacker just needs to send crafted input.  
- **User Interaction:** Usually required, as the victim must visit the malicious page or trigger the stored XSS payload.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (web application).  
- **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability can be impacted to varying degrees depending on the XSS payload. Usually, confidentiality and integrity are impacted (e.g., stealing cookies, session tokens, or modifying displayed content). Availability impact is often none or low.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via HTTP requests.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond submitting crafted input.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., visit the page where the malicious script is stored) for the exploit to succeed.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of some information (e.g., cookies, tokens), but not full system compromise.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  XSS can allow modification of displayed content or execution of scripts, but not full system compromise.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  XSS typically does not impact availability.

#####4#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Out-of-bounds Write vulnerabilities in svc1td_vld_plh_ap of libsthmbc.so prior to SMR Feb-2024 Release 1 allows local attackers to trigger buffer overflow.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by "local attackers," which means the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; buffer overflow triggered by local attacker suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "local attackers," but it does not specify if they need any privileges. Usually, local buffer overflow vulnerabilities require at least some user-level privileges (not necessarily admin). Since it says "local attackers" without specifying "privileged," assume Low privileges required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required; the attacker triggers the vulnerability directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Buffer overflow in a local library (libsthmbc.so) likely affects the same security scope (same process or system). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Buffer overflow can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact. Usually, buffer overflows can lead to at least some confidentiality impact. Assume Low (L) impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Buffer overflow can allow code execution or modification of data, so integrity is impacted. Assume High (H) impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service. Assume Low (L) impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      |
| Scope (S)            | U      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      |
| Integrity (I)        | H      |
| Availability (A)     | L      |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.268)  
= 6.42 * 0.732  
≈ 4.70

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.70 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(6.53)  
= 6.5 (Medium severity)

#####5#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: Filterable Gallery widget in Essential Addons for Elementor plugin
- Versions: up to and including 5.9.4
- Cause: insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on Image URL
- Attackers: authenticated users with contributor-level and above permissions
- Impact: injection of arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via the plugin's widget.  
- The injection happens through the web interface (plugin widget), so the attacker must have access to the WordPress admin dashboard or contributor interface.  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access to the machine, but must be authenticated.  
- The attack is performed over the network (HTTP requests to the WordPress site).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the required permissions.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor is a low-level privilege in WordPress, but it is not "None".  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges mean the attacker has some privileges but not administrative.  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker injects scripts that execute when other users access the injected page.  
- The attacker does not require any user interaction to perform the attack itself.  
- However, the impact (script execution) requires a user to visit the page.  
- According to CVSS, UI is about whether the attacker needs another user to do something to exploit the vulnerability.  
- Here, the attacker can inject the script without user interaction, but the script executes when a user visits the page (which is outside the attacker's control).  
- The CVSS guidance states that if exploitation requires a user to do something (e.g., click a link), UI = Required.  
- In stored XSS, the attacker injects the payload, but the victim must visit the page for the payload to execute.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (WordPress application).  
- The impact is on the application itself, not on other components or security domains.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This can lead to partial or full disclosure of information.  
- Usually, XSS is rated as Low (L) or High (H) depending on the impact.  
- Since the description does not specify full data disclosure, but arbitrary script execution, which can lead to data theft, we assign Low (L) for confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, which can modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This can lead to modification of data or content.  
- Therefore, Integrity = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- Stored XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N)

|----------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable over the network via HTTP requests                                         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploitation, no special conditions                                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires contributor-level or above permissions                                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Requires victim user to visit the injected page for script execution                   |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact confined to the vulnerable component/application                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible disclosure of sensitive information via script execution                      |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of content/data via script execution                             |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                              |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.516

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.516 + 2.068, 10))  
= round_up(4.584)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the argument "title".
- Component: Post Handler in qkmc-rk redbbs 1.0.
- Attack Vector: Remote attack possible.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Impact: XSS typically affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability to varying degrees, often low or none for confidentiality and availability, but can affect integrity or confidentiality depending on context.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."  
- Remote means Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS via argument manipulation is usually straightforward.  
- So, Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Usually, XSS can be exploited by unauthenticated users.  
- So, None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS requires a victim to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a crafted URL or view a post).  
- So, User Interaction is Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually, this is considered Low (L) impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is usually Low (L) impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- So, None (N).

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote attack possible over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward attack |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (e.g., visit malicious link) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, affects same security domain |
| C      | L     | Possible disclosure of information |
| I      | L     | Possible modification of content or actions |
| A      | N     | No impact on availability |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.51 + 2.25)  
= Round_up (4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"There is a local privilege escalation vulnerability of ZTE's ZXCLOUD iRAI. Attackers with regular user privileges can create a fake process, and to escalate local privileges."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires the attacker to have regular user privileges on the local system and create a fake process. This implies the attacker must be on the system already.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit the vulnerability beyond having regular user privileges. Creating a fake process is generally straightforward for a local user.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must have regular user privileges (not no privileges, but not admin either). Regular user privileges correspond to Low privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any need for user interaction (e.g., tricking another user). The attacker is already a user on the system.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation, meaning the attacker’s privileges increase from regular user to higher privileges (e.g., root or admin). This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact (e.g., data disclosure). Privilege escalation typically implies some confidentiality impact, but since it's not explicitly stated, we assume Low (L) because gaining higher privileges can lead to some data access.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Privilege escalation allows the attacker to modify system files or processes, so integrity is impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability (e.g., denial of service).  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to exploit |
| PR     | L     | Requires regular user privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Privilege escalation changes scope |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact likely |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to privilege escalation |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.44 × 1)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.3432)  
= 7.52 × 0.6568 ≈ 4.94

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (Minimum [1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= 1.08 × (4.94 + 1.83) = 1.08 × 6.77 = 7.31 → 7.3 (rounded to one decimal)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is a **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**.
- Affects multiple WordPress plugins and themes.
- SSRF typically allows an attacker to make the server perform HTTP requests to arbitrary locations.
- SSRF is usually exploitable remotely (over the network).
- SSRF often requires no privileges (can be exploited by unauthenticated users).
- Usually, no user interaction is required.
- The impact depends on what the SSRF can access:
  - Confidentiality: Potentially high if internal resources or sensitive data can be accessed.
  - Integrity: Usually low or none, as SSRF mainly reads data or triggers requests.
  - Availability: Usually low or none, unless SSRF can cause DoS.
- Scope: SSRF can sometimes lead to impact beyond the vulnerable component, but typically the scope remains unchanged unless it leads to privilege escalation or other impacts.

---

### Metric-by-metric analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   SSRF is exploitable remotely over the network.  
   **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   SSRF vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit without special conditions.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   Usually, SSRF can be exploited without authentication or privileges.  
   **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   SSRF exploitation typically does not require user interaction.  
   **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   SSRF usually affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application). No indication of scope change here.  
   **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   SSRF can allow access to internal resources or sensitive data, so confidentiality impact is likely **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on the context. Since the description does not specify data exfiltration or full disclosure, but SSRF is often used to access internal resources, we assign **Low (L)**.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   SSRF usually does not allow modification of data, so integrity impact is likely **None (N)**.  
   **Value:** None (N)

8. **Availability (A):**  
   SSRF usually does not cause denial of service or availability impact.  
   **Value:** None (N)

- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.91, 10))

#####9#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Statamic CMS allows uploading HTML files disguised as JPGs, leading to XSS.
- Affects front-end forms (asset fields) and control panel asset browser.
- No mime type validation.
- Exploitation requires an authorized user to execute the XSS.
- If crafted specifically, the XSS can be used to steal password reset tokens and gain account access.
- The vulnerability is patched in versions 4.46.0 and 3.4.17.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by uploading files and executing XSS via front-end forms and control panel asset browser.  
- The attacker must upload a crafted file, which implies some level of access to the system (front-end or control panel).  
- The front-end forms are accessible over the network, and the control panel is likely accessible over the network but requires authentication.  
- Since the attacker must be an authorized user (implies some level of access), but the attack is performed remotely via web interface, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must craft HTML files disguised as JPGs and exploit the XSS in a specific way to steal tokens.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements beyond crafting the payload.  
- The complexity is not high; the attacker just needs to upload a crafted file and execute XSS.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an authorized user to execute the XSS.  
- The description says "authorized user is required to execute the XSS."  
- This means the attacker must have some privileges (not None).  
- The level of privileges is not specified as high (e.g., admin), so assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must execute the XSS, but is the victim required to do anything?  
- The description says the authorized user must execute the XSS, implying the attacker is the authorized user.  
- No mention of other users needing to interact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stealing password reset tokens and gaining access to accounts.  
- This implies a change in scope because the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., user accounts).  
- The attacker can escalate privileges or access other components.  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal password reset tokens and gain access to accounts.  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute XSS and potentially gain access to accounts, which implies they can modify data or perform actions as the user.  
- This is a high integrity impact.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible via web interface |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to craft payload |
| PR     | L     | Authorized user required (low privileges) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond attacker |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to account access |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (password reset tokens) |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact (account takeover) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
  ≈ 2.25

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
  = 1 - 0.1936  
  = 0.8064

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.8064 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.8064 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.7774 - 3.25 × (0.7864)^15  
  = 5.846 - 3.25 × 0.041 (approximate)  
  = 5.846 - 0.133  
  = 5.713

- Base Score (Scope Changed) =  
  If Impact ≤ 0, then 0  
  Else, round up to 1 decimal place:  
  min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
  = 1.08 × (5.713 + 2.25)  
  = 1.08 × 7.963

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An information disclosure flaw in ansible-core where the ANSIBLE_NO_LOG configuration is not respected in some scenarios, causing sensitive information (like decrypted secret values) to be included in output during certain tasks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The flaw occurs during the execution of ansible tasks, which are typically run remotely via network connections (e.g., SSH).  
- Since the issue is about output in tasks, and Ansible is a remote automation tool, the attacker can trigger this over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The flaw happens due to a failure to respect a configuration setting in some scenarios.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond running certain tasks with specific configurations.  
- This suggests low complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to run Ansible tasks that trigger the information disclosure.  
- Typically, running Ansible tasks requires some level of privileges on the control machine or target.  
- However, since the flaw is about output leaking sensitive info during task execution, the attacker likely needs to have the ability to run tasks (i.e., some privileges).  
- The description does not specify that no privileges are needed, so assume **Low (L)** privileges required (e.g., ability to run tasks but not full admin).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The flaw is in the output of tasks; no indication that another user must interact for the flaw to be exploited.  
- The attacker runs the tasks themselves.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The flaw causes information disclosure within the same security scope (the Ansible process or environment).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The flaw causes sensitive information (decrypted secret values) to be included in output.  
- This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
- The impact is significant but may not be total system compromise.  
- Given that secret values are disclosed, this is likely **High (H)** confidentiality impact.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the flaw affects data integrity.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the flaw affects availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in CodeAstro Online Railway Reservation System 1.0
- Affects pass-profile.php file
- Type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of First Name/Last Name/User Name parameters
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted request over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a straightforward XSS via parameter manipulation.  
- No special conditions or environment needed.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any authentication or privileges needed.  
- Usually, XSS in user input fields that are publicly accessible require no privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For XSS, the victim (user) must interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a crafted URL or view a malicious page).  
- So, user interaction is required.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually, this is considered Low impact on confidentiality because it depends on the context and exploitation.  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically Low impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N)

= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U),  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
"EDK2 is susceptible to a vulnerability in the Tcg2MeasurePeImage() function, allowing a user to trigger a heap buffer overflow via a local network. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description says "via a local network."  
  CVSS AV options: Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P)  
  "Local network" typically means the attacker must be on the same local network segment, not remote over the internet. This corresponds to **Adjacent (A)**.  
  **AV = A**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity. Heap buffer overflow triggered by a user action. Usually, if no special conditions are mentioned, assume Low.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "allowing a user to trigger..." but does not specify if the user needs any privileges. Since it says "user" and not "administrator" or "root," and the attack is via local network, it likely requires no privileges.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description says "allowing a user to trigger..." which implies user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in EDK2 firmware code (Tcg2MeasurePeImage function). Firmware vulnerabilities often affect the system beyond the vulnerable component, but the description does not explicitly say the scope changes.  
  Since the heap buffer overflow is in a function that measures PE images, and the impact is on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but no explicit scope change is mentioned, assume **Scope Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description says "may result in a compromise of confidentiality." So, at least Low.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  "may result in a compromise of integrity."  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  "may result in a compromise of availability."  
  **A = Low (L)**

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Local network attack |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required |
| S      | U     | No scope change indicated |
| C      | L     | Confidentiality impact possible |
| I      | L     | Integrity impact possible |
| A      | L     | Availability impact possible |

### Step 2: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85) (since Scope=Unchanged)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.252 ≈ 2.07

**Impact Subscore = 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.474)  
= 6 × 0.526 = 3.156

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.156 + 2.07, 10))  
= round_up(5.226) = 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"In vsp driver, there is a possible use after free due to a logic error. This could lead to local denial of service with System execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a driver and requires local privileges ("System execution privileges needed"). This implies the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description mentions a "logic error" leading to use after free. No indication that the attack is complex or requires special conditions beyond normal exploitation. Use after free bugs are generally straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which means the attacker must already have high-level privileges (System is the highest privilege level on Windows).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker with system privileges can trigger the vulnerability directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in a driver, and the impact is local denial of service. Since the privileges required are system-level and the impact is denial of service on the same system, the scope is likely unchanged (the impact is within the same security scope).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The impact is denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption, only denial of service.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The impact is denial of service, so availability is affected. The description does not specify the severity, but "denial of service" generally corresponds to at least Low impact. Since it is a use after free leading to DoS, it could be Low or High. Given the severity implied by "System execution privileges needed" and use after free, but only DoS impact, we assign Low (L) availability impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | H     | System privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Denial of service impact (low) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(2.20)  
= 2.2 → 2.2 rounds to 2.2 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- **Product:** Nginx-UI (web interface for managing Nginx configurations)
- **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary command execution by abusing configuration settings.
- **Attack Vector:** Remote (via web interface/API)
- **Authentication:** Requires authentication (mentions "authenticated remote code execution")
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure
- **User Interaction:** Not explicitly mentioned, but likely none since attacker can send API requests directly.
- **Scope:** Potentially changed due to privilege escalation and remote code execution.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** All impacted to some degree.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network via the web interface/API.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must abuse the API to modify a setting that is not exposed in the UI.  
- This requires some knowledge but no special conditions or race conditions are mentioned.  
- The attacker must be authenticated, but the complexity of the attack itself is low.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description states "authenticated remote code execution," implying the attacker must be logged in.  
- It is not clear if the attacker needs low or high privileges, but since the attacker can modify sensitive settings, likely low privileges are sufficient.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a request to the API directly; no user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to privilege escalation and remote code execution, which likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- This implies the scope is changed.  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Information disclosure is mentioned.  
- The impact is likely high because secrets like `Jwt Secret` and `Node Secret` can be exposed.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary command execution and privilege escalation imply full control over the system, so integrity is fully compromised.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Remote code execution can lead to denial of service or system disruption.  
- **Value:** High (H)

|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via API |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Requires authentication but low privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Privilege escalation changes scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (secrets disclosure) |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact (arbitrary command execution) |
| A      | H     | High availability impact (potential DoS) |

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Origin validation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One security agent.  
- Impact: Allows a local attacker to escalate privileges.  
- Exploitation prerequisite: Attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.  
- Attack vector: Local (since attacker must execute code locally).  
- Privileges required: Low (attacker must have low-privileged code execution).  
- User interaction: Not mentioned, so assume none required.  
- Scope: Privilege escalation implies impact beyond initial privileges, so scope is Changed.  
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: Privilege escalation primarily affects Integrity (elevated privileges), possibly Availability and Confidentiality depending on what the attacker can do with escalated privileges. Usually, privilege escalation is considered High impact on Integrity, and often High on Confidentiality and Availability as well, but since the description only mentions privilege escalation, we can assume High Integrity impact, and Low or None for Confidentiality and Availability unless otherwise stated.  
- Attack Complexity: Not stated as complex, so assume Low.

---

### Metric Values:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must execute code locally.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: No special conditions or complexity mentioned.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must have low-privileged code execution.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  Reason: No user interaction mentioned.

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation changes scope (from low privilege to higher privilege).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation may allow some data access, but not explicitly stated as full data disclosure.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation directly impacts integrity.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  Reason: No mention of availability impact.

- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection typically requires low complexity if no special conditions are needed.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an HTTP POST parameter remotely.  
- Usually, SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications do not require privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request; no user interaction is required.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection affects the database or data controlled by the vulnerable component.  
- Usually, the scope remains unchanged unless the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- No indication that the scope changes here.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since it is critical and the description implies significant impact, assume High impact on confidentiality.  
- C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow data modification or deletion.  
- Assume High impact on integrity.  
- I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**

= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.97, 10))  
= round_up(9.85) = 9.9

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **9.9**, which is critical.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: jshERP v3.3
- Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Upload
- Details: The upload interface does not check the uploaded file type, and the "biz" parameter can be manipulated to control the upload path, allowing arbitrary file uploads.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited via a web interface (upload interface).  
- The attacker can upload files remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability arises because the file type is not checked and the path can be controlled via a parameter.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any authentication or privileges needed to upload files.  
- Usually, upload interfaces are accessible without authentication or with minimal privileges.  
- Assuming no privileges required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker uploads files directly; no user interaction is needed.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary file upload with controllable paths.  
- This likely leads to code execution or modification of resources outside the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- The "biz" parameter controls the upload path, which suggests the attacker can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary file upload can lead to information disclosure if the attacker uploads a web shell or malicious script.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
- The impact on confidentiality is likely Low (L) because the attacker can potentially read or access files indirectly.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary file upload allows the attacker to modify or add files, which affects integrity.  
- This is a High (H) impact because the attacker can upload arbitrary files, potentially replacing or adding malicious files.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker could upload files that disrupt service (e.g., overwrite critical files or upload large files to exhaust disk space).  
- This is likely Low (L) impact because availability could be affected but not completely denied.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible upload interface |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to arbitrary file upload affecting other components |
| C      | L     | Potential for some confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to arbitrary file upload |
| A      | L     | Some availability impact possible |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.267)  
= 7.52 * 0.733  
= 5.51

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= 1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)  
= 1.08 * (5.51 + 3.89)  
= 1.08 * 9.40  
= 10.15 → capped at 10.0

### Summary of Base Metrics:

- AV:N  
- AC:L  
- PR:N  
- UI:R  
- S:U  
- C:L  
- I:L  
- A:N

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####21#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Arbitrary Command Injection via unsanitized input to a function.
- Impact: Attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands.
- Condition: Attacker-controlled input is passed to a function.
- Package version: before 0.7.0.
- Environment: The package runs on an OS, so commands execute on the OS.
- No mention of user interaction required.
- No mention of privilege requirements.
- No mention of scope change.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a package function that accepts attacker-controlled input.  
- The attacker must provide input to the function, presumably remotely or locally?  
- The description does not explicitly say if the attacker must be local or remote.  
- Since this is a package function, it depends on how the package is used. However, typically, if the package is used in a networked environment or accepts input from a network source, the vector is Network.  
- Given the description, it is most reasonable to assume Network (N) because arbitrary command injection is often exploitable remotely if the package processes network input.  
**AV = N**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to lack of input sanitization.  
- The attacker just needs to provide crafted input.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, Attack Complexity is Low (L).  
**AC = L**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker provides input to the function.  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges to exploit.  
- So, Privileges Required is None (N).  
**PR = N**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker controls the input directly.  
- No mention of needing another user to interact.  
- So, User Interaction is None (N).  
**UI = N**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary commands on the OS where the package runs.  
- The package is a component running on the OS.  
- The impact is on the OS, which is outside the package boundary.  
- This means the scope is Changed (C).  
**S = C**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary command execution can lead to full system compromise, including reading sensitive data.  
- So, Confidentiality impact is High (H).  
**C = H**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary command execution allows modification of data and system files.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).  
**I = H**

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary command execution can disrupt or disable system services.  
- Availability impact is High (H).  
**A = H**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)  

---

### Step 3: Final CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####22#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in search-visitor.php
- Affected product: PHPGurukul Company Visitor Management System 1.0
- Attack vector: Remote
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- Severity: Critical

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- SQL Injection typically can be exploited over the network (e.g., via web requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities usually have low complexity if no special conditions are required.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely and exploit SQL injection.  
- Usually, SQL injection does not require any privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted input to the vulnerable script.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since the vulnerability is critical and SQL injection is involved, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact (e.g., full database disclosure).  
- Therefore, C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Usually, it can lead to high integrity impact (e.g., data modification or deletion).  
- Therefore, I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but not always.  
- Since the description does not mention availability impact, but the vulnerability is critical, it is reasonable to assume at least low impact on availability.  
- To be conservative, assign Low (L) availability impact.  
- Therefore, A = Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Low availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.78]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.3432]  
= 1 - 0.151  
= 0.849

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Impact Score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.849  
= 5.45

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup(Min[5.45 + 3.89, 10])  
= Roundup(9.34)  
= 9.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

#####23#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in flaskBlog, a Flask-based blog app.
- Improper storage and rendering of user comments on `/user/<user>` page.
- The template uses `{{comment[2]|safe}}`, which disables escaping and allows arbitrary JavaScript execution.
- This is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- No fix is available; users must manually edit the template.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is triggered by visiting a user page `/user/<user>`.
- The attacker can submit comments that get rendered with unsafe HTML/JS.
- The attack can be performed remotely by sending crafted input (comments) that get stored and then viewed by others.
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.

**AV = Network (N)**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker needs to submit a comment containing malicious JavaScript.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- The vulnerability is straightforward to exploit once the comment is submitted.
- No complex conditions or environment needed.

**AC = Low (L)**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- Does the attacker need any privileges to exploit?

- The attacker must be able to submit a comment.

- Usually, blog comments are allowed for unauthenticated users or at least low-privilege users.

- The description does not specify that the attacker must be authenticated.

- Assuming comments can be submitted without authentication or with low privileges.

- To be conservative, assume **None (N)** if comments are public, or **Low (L)** if login is required.

- Since the description does not specify authentication, assume **None (N)**.

**PR = None (N)**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires a victim to visit the vulnerable page to execute the malicious JavaScript.

- The attacker submits the malicious comment, but the victim must view the page.

- Therefore, user interaction is required.

**UI = Required (R)**

---

**Scope (S):**

- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?

- The vulnerability is an XSS in the web app, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable web app.

- The impact is limited to the same security scope (the web app).

- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or privileges outside the web app.

**S = Unchanged (U)**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the web app.

- This is a typical **Low (L)** confidentiality impact because the attacker can steal user data or perform actions on behalf of the user.

- Not High because the attacker does not directly access the server's confidential data.

**C = Low (L)**

---

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially modifying content or performing actions as the user.

- This is a **Low (L)** integrity impact.

- Not High because the attacker cannot directly modify server data arbitrarily, only via the victim's browser.

**I = Low (L)**

---

**Availability (A):**

- XSS typically does not impact availability.

- No indication that the vulnerability causes denial of service.

**A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Base Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector (remote comment submission) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to submit comments |
| UI     | R     | User must view the malicious comment |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, impact limited to web app |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact (data theft via XSS) |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (actions via victim's browser) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836 (approx)

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515 (approx)

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 2.836)  
= Round_up (5.351)  
= 5.4

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**

#####25#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection via manipulation of the argument "sex" in update_personal_info.php.
- Affected product: code-projects Human Resource Integrated System 1.0.
- Attack vector: The attack may be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Severity: Critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- SQL Injection typically occurs over a network request (e.g., HTTP).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection via argument manipulation is usually straightforward if input validation is missing.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument in a web request.  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, SQL Injection in a public-facing web app requires no privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable parameter.  
- No mention that a user must perform any action for the attack to succeed.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection typically affects the database and can lead to data leakage or modification.  
- The vulnerability is in a web application, and the impact is on the same security scope (the web app and its database).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- The description says "critical" and implies data can be accessed/manipulated.  
- Usually, SQL Injection leads to High confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Therefore, I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but no explicit mention here.  
- Since the description is silent on availability impact, but given the critical nature, it is reasonable to assume at least Low impact on availability.  
- However, if no explicit mention, the conservative approach is Low (L).  
- Therefore, A = Low (L).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: High (H)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: Low (L)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.3432]  
= 1 - 0.151  
= 0.849

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.849  
= 5.45

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.34)  
= 9.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####26#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The POST SMTP WordPress plugin before 2.8.7 does not sanitise and escape the msg parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a crafted request that includes the malicious payload in the "msg" parameter, which is reflected back in the page.
- **Target:** High privilege users such as admin.
- **Impact:** Potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for the affected user.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request.  
- This is a network attack.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request.  
- No special environment or timing conditions are mentioned.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges to send the malicious request.  
- However, the impact is on high privilege users (admin), but the attacker does not need privileges to perform the attack.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Reflected XSS requires the victim (admin) to click a malicious link or visit a crafted URL.  
- So user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the WordPress plugin and the user session).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially modifying data.  
- Partial loss of integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability directly.  
- No indication of availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via crafted HTTP request |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to send payload |
| UI     | R     | User (admin) must interact (click link) |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (data theft) |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact (actions on behalf) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####27#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in B&R Industrial Automation Automation Studio allows Relative Path Traversal. This issue affects Automation Studio: from 4.0 through 4.12.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Relative Path Traversal  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to access files or directories that are outside the intended directory. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure or modification of files.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   Relative Path Traversal vulnerabilities are typically exploitable remotely if the software accepts user input that is not properly sanitized. Since Automation Studio is a software product, and the vulnerability is in the software itself, the attack vector depends on how the software is accessed.  
   - If the software is accessed over a network (e.g., via a network service or web interface), AV:N (Network) applies.  
   - If the software is local-only, AV:L (Local) applies.  
   
   Since the description does not specify network access, but Automation Studio is an industrial automation software which often runs on local machines, and the vulnerability is a relative path traversal (usually local), the most conservative assumption is **Local (L)**.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   Relative Path Traversal vulnerabilities usually require low complexity to exploit if input is not sanitized.  
   - AC:L (Low) is appropriate.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   Does the attacker need privileges?  
   - If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any privileges, PR:N (None).  
   - If the attacker must be a user on the system, PR:L (Low).  
   
   Since the vulnerability is in Automation Studio software, which is likely installed on a user machine, and the attacker needs to interact with the software, it is likely that the attacker needs to have some user privileges on the system. So PR:L (Low) is appropriate.

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   Does the attack require user interaction?  
   - Usually, path traversal vulnerabilities do not require user interaction if the attacker can send crafted input directly.  
   - So UI:N (None).

5. **Scope (S):**  
   Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component?  
   - Relative Path Traversal can allow access to files outside the intended directory, potentially affecting other components or system files.  
   - This usually means Scope is Changed (C).

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   Can the attacker read sensitive information?  
   - Yes, path traversal can lead to unauthorized disclosure of files.  
   - So C:L (Low) or C:H (High).  
   - Since the description does not specify full disclosure of all files, but just traversal, C:L (Low) is appropriate.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   Can the attacker modify files?  
   - Path traversal can allow modification if the attacker can write to files. The description does not specify write access.  
   - Assume no integrity impact: I:N (None).

8. **Availability (A):**  
   Can the attacker affect availability?  
   - No indication of availability impact.  
   - A:N (None).

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (user-level) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to access outside intended directory |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact (some file disclosure) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 7.52 × 0.22 ≈ 1.65

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [1.65 + 1.83, 10])  
= Roundup (3.48) = 3.5

#####28#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The vulnerability involves BuildKit, a toolkit used in building container images.
- A malicious BuildKit frontend or Dockerfile using the RUN --mount feature can trick the system into removing a file outside the container, on the host system.
- This implies an attacker can cause unintended file deletion on the host.
- The issue is fixed in v0.12.5.
- Workarounds include avoiding untrusted frontends or Dockerfiles.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves a malicious BuildKit frontend or Dockerfile.  
- The attacker must supply a crafted Dockerfile or frontend.  
- This implies the attacker must have some way to provide input to the build process, likely locally or via a build system.  
- However, BuildKit is often used locally or in CI environments, but the attack requires the attacker to supply a malicious Dockerfile or frontend.  
- Since the attacker must provide a malicious Dockerfile or frontend, this is likely **Local (L)** or possibly **Adjacent (A)** if the attacker can influence builds over a network.  
- But since the attack requires supplying a malicious Dockerfile or frontend, which is a file or input to the build system, and not remote code execution over the network, **Local (L)** is most appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must craft a malicious Dockerfile or frontend using the RUN --mount feature.  
- This requires some knowledge but no special conditions or timing.  
- The attack is straightforward once the attacker can supply the input.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must supply a malicious Dockerfile or frontend.  
- This implies the attacker can run builds or submit Dockerfiles to the build system.  
- If the build system is accessible without privileges, then PR = None.  
- If the attacker must have some privileges to run builds, then PR = Low or High.  
- Usually, building images requires at least some user privileges on the build system.  
- Since the attacker must be able to run builds or supply Dockerfiles, likely **Low (L)** privileges are required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack involves supplying a malicious Dockerfile or frontend.  
- No other user interaction is required for the attack to succeed once the malicious input is provided.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows removal of files outside the container, on the host system.  
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries from container to host.  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes file deletion, not data disclosure.  
- No confidentiality impact.  
- **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can delete files on the host, which affects integrity of the host filesystem.  
- This is a significant integrity impact.  
- **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Deleting files on the host can cause denial of service or system instability.  
- This is a significant availability impact.  
- **High (H)**.

| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Attacker needs some privileges to run builds or supply Dockerfiles.                    |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required after malicious input is supplied.                        |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact crosses from container to host system.                                          |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact.                                                             |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Host files can be deleted, high integrity impact.                                      |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Host files deletion can cause denial of service, high availability impact.             |

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.25

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - [1 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
  = 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.8064 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.8064 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.7774 - 3.25 × (0.7864)^15  
  = 5.85 - 3.25 × 0.041 (approximate)  
  = 5.85 - 0.13 = 5.72

- Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
  = Roundup(Min(5.72 + 2.25, 10))  
  = Roundup(7.97) = 8.0

- However, arbitrary file upload can lead to code execution or data exposure indirectly.  
- Since the description only mentions unrestricted upload, not direct data disclosure, assign **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Uploading arbitrary files can allow an attacker to modify or add files, potentially leading to code execution or defacement.  
- This is a direct impact on integrity.  
- Assign **High** impact.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- Arbitrary upload could be used to overwrite files or fill disk space, but no explicit mention.  
- Assign **None** or **Low**. Given no explicit mention, safer to assign **None**.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |

| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible data exposure but not explicit |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.3432  
= 0.6568

Impact = 6.42 × ISC_Base  
= 6.42 × 0.6568  
= 4.22

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (4.22 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (8.11)  
= 8.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####31#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is in the cryptographic library Ursa and AnonCreds implementations.
- The issue is a weakness in the key correctness proof, allowing a malicious issuer to create weakened private keys.
- This could allow the issuer to link presentations to specific holders, breaking unlinkability.
- The impact is on confidentiality of the credential holders' identity linkage.
- The attack requires a malicious issuer to create a custom implementation.
- No fix is expected; the project is end-of-life.
- The attack scenario involves the issuer (likely remote or local?), but the description implies the attacker is the issuer who generates keys.
- The attacker is the issuer, so the attacker has some privileges (likely high).
- The attack does not require user interaction.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the impact is on the same security authority (the issuer and holder relationship).
- The impact is on confidentiality (linkability), but no direct impact on integrity or availability is described.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is the issuer who creates a custom implementation.  
- The issuer is likely a privileged entity in the system, but the attack vector is not network-based or physical.  
- The attack involves creating a custom implementation, which suggests local or adjacent.  
- Since the issuer is a privileged entity who generates keys, this is likely **Local (L)** or possibly **Adjacent (A)**.  
- However, since the issuer is the one generating keys, and this is a software library, the attacker must have local access to the system or environment where the keys are generated.  
- **AV:L (Local)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must create a custom CL Signature implementation with weakened keys.  
- This requires specialized knowledge and effort.  
- Therefore, **High (H)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is the issuer who generates keys.  
- This implies **High (H)** privileges are required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No user interaction is required for the attack.  
- **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The impact is on the confidentiality of the credential holders.  
- The issuer is the attacker, and the impact is on the same security authority (the issuer and holder relationship).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can link presentations to holders, breaking unlinkability.  
- This is a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data or system integrity is affected.  
- **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No impact on availability described.  
- **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.0557 ≈ 0.457

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 0.457, 10))  
= round_up(4.052)  
= 4.1 (Medium severity)

#####32#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Qualys Jenkins Plugin for WAS (<= 2.0.11).
- Missing permission check during connectivity check to Qualys Cloud Services.
- Any user with login access (i.e., some level of authenticated access) can configure or edit jobs.
- This allows configuring a rogue endpoint.
- The rogue endpoint can be used to inject XXE payloads.
- Result: XXE vulnerability during response data processing.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack requires the attacker to have login access to Jenkins and configure/edit jobs.  
- This implies the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the Jenkins UI or API.  
- The attacker is not remote unauthenticated, but the attack is performed over the network (Jenkins is typically accessed over the network).  
- Since the attacker must be logged in and interact with the system, the vector is **Network (N)** because the attacker interacts remotely over the network.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must have login access and configure jobs, but no special conditions or race conditions are mentioned.  
- The attack seems straightforward once logged in.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have login access and be able to configure or edit jobs.  
- This is more than no privileges but less than full admin.  
- Jenkins has different roles; "configure or edit jobs" is typically a **Low (L)** privilege level (not full admin).  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is a user with login access and performs the attack themselves.  
- No other user interaction is required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to control response data processing in the plugin, which is part of Jenkins.  
- The impact is on Jenkins itself (same security authority).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of Jenkins.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XXE can lead to disclosure of confidential data (e.g., local files, internal resources).  
- The description implies data disclosure via XXE.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject payloads that control response processing, but no direct indication of modifying data or code.  
- XXE typically does not modify data, but can cause indirect effects.  
- The description does not mention integrity impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network access required (login over network) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward attack |
| PR     | L     | Requires login with job configuration privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond attacker |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope (Jenkins) |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact due to XXE data disclosure |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact mentioned |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of:  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else if Scope Unchanged:  
Base Score = min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 3.59 + 2.69 = 6.28 → 6.3

#####34#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in IP2Location IP2Location Country Blocker. This issue affects IP2Location Country Blocker: from n/a through 2.33.3.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor  
- **Affected product:** IP2Location Country Blocker  
- **Versions affected:** up to 2.33.3

This is an information disclosure vulnerability.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS base metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Since this is a web-based plugin/module (Country Blocker), the vulnerability is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No indication that the attack requires special conditions or complex steps. Usually, information disclosure vulnerabilities in web plugins are straightforward to exploit.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor," implying no privileges are required to exploit.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. Usually, information disclosure vulnerabilities in web plugins do not require user interaction.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the vulnerable component itself). No indication that the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Since this is an information disclosure vulnerability, confidentiality is impacted. The severity is not specified as total disclosure, so assume **Low (L)**.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No indication that integrity is affected.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **A = None (N)**

| AV     | N     | Network exploit possible |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity attack |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Impact Sub-Score (ISC):**  
ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 1 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

**Impact:**  
Impact = 6.42 * ISC  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.4124

**Exploitability:**  
Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
= approx 3.89

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.4124 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(5.3024)  
= 5.3

#####35#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically in the sfc: farch driver.  
- The issue is a logic error in TX queue lookup during TX flush done handling.  
- The function efx_get_tx_queue() is used incorrectly, which could return NULL and lead to kernel panics.  
- Kernel panics typically cause denial of service (availability impact).  
- The flaw is a programming error that can cause system crashes.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel driver.  
- Exploitation likely requires local access to the system (e.g., running code or triggering the driver).  
- Kernel vulnerabilities are generally local unless exposed remotely.  
- No indication this can be exploited remotely over the network.  
- **Value: Local (L)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a logic error causing a NULL pointer dereference.  
- Exploiting this likely requires triggering a specific sequence of events (TX flush done handling with a specific TXQ instance number).  
- This is not trivial but also not highly complex.  
- Usually, kernel NULL pointer dereference bugs have low complexity if local access is available.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel driver bug, triggering it likely requires some level of privilege.  
- Normal userspace processes may not be able to directly interact with the driver or cause the TX flush done handling.  
- However, if the driver is accessible to unprivileged users (e.g., via device files), PR could be None or Low.  
- Without explicit info, assume the attacker needs to be a local user with some privileges to interact with the driver.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is in kernel code, triggered by internal kernel operations.  
- No indication that user interaction is required to trigger the bug.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a kernel panic (system crash).  
- Kernel panic affects the entire system, not just the vulnerable component.  
- This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects system-wide availability.  
- **Value: Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The bug causes a NULL pointer dereference leading to a panic.  
- No indication of data disclosure.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data integrity is affected.  
- The bug causes a crash, not data modification.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:H (0.56)  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

**Base Score:**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0, else:  
BaseScore = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup(Min[4.21 + 1.83, 10])  
= Roundup(6.04)  
= 6.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
swftools 0.9.2 was discovered to contain a Stack Buffer Underflow via the function dict_foreach_keyvalue at swftools/lib/q.c.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stack Buffer Underflow (a memory corruption issue)
- **Component:** swftools 0.9.2, specifically in a function dict_foreach_keyvalue
- **Impact:** Likely allows an attacker to manipulate memory, potentially leading to code execution, data corruption, or denial of service.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since this is a software library function, the attack likely requires the attacker to provide crafted input to the software.  
- If the software processes files or data over the network, the attack vector could be Network.  
- swftools is a command-line tool for working with SWF files, so the attacker likely needs to provide a crafted file locally or remotely.  
- Usually, such vulnerabilities are exploited by providing a crafted file to the software, which is run locally.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stack buffer underflow vulnerabilities are usually straightforward to exploit if the attacker can control the input.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to run the vulnerable software with their own privileges.  
- No elevated privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must provide a crafted file to the software.  
- The user must run the software with the malicious input.  
- This implies user interaction is required (the user runs the program).  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a memory corruption in the software itself.  
- It likely affects only the vulnerable component and does not affect other components or privileges outside the software.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- A stack buffer underflow can lead to information disclosure.  
- But the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
- However, memory corruption often leads to at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Assign **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can allow modification of data or code.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Such vulnerabilities can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local execution with crafted input file |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must run the program with crafted input |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects only the software itself |
| C      | L     | Possible information disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible data modification |
| A      | L     | Possible denial of service |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 1.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.20) = 5.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem, specifically in nfnetlink_osf.  
- The function nf_osf_find() incorrectly returns true on mismatch, causing uninitialized memory to be copied in nft_osf.  
- This can be exploited to leak stale kernel stack data to userspace.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem, which is related to network packet filtering.  
- Exploitation likely occurs remotely by sending crafted network packets.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a logic flaw causing a function to return true incorrectly, leading to memory leakage.  
- No special conditions or timing requirements are mentioned.  
- This suggests a straightforward exploitation.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability leaks kernel stack data to userspace.  
- The description implies that an unprivileged user can trigger this by sending packets (userspace).  
- No mention of needing elevated privileges.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted packets to trigger the flaw.  
- No user interaction is required from the victim.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leaks kernel memory to userspace.  
- The impact crosses from kernel (privileged) to user (unprivileged) space.  
- This means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability leaks stale kernel stack data to userspace.  
- This is a confidentiality impact.  
- The leak is of kernel memory, which is significant but not total system compromise.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of denial of service or availability impact.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44 × 1 × 1)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [4.21 + 3.89, 10])  
= Roundup (8.10)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The Better Comments WordPress plugin before 1.5.6 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow low privilege users such as Subscribers to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by low privilege users (Subscribers) through the plugin's settings. Since this is a web plugin vulnerability and the attacker must interact with the web application, the attack is performed over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is due to lack of sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once the attacker has access. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be a low privilege user (Subscriber), not an unauthenticated user. So privileges are required but low.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which typically requires a victim user to view the malicious content for the attack to succeed. The attacker injects the payload, but another user must interact (view) the stored malicious content.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the WordPress plugin and its data). It does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stored XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information from the victim's browser (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, potentially altering data or actions performed by the victim. This is typically considered a **Low** impact on integrity.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- curl kept SSL session IDs in its cache even when OCSP stapling verification failed.
- A subsequent transfer to the same hostname could reuse the cached session ID.
- This reuse skips the verify status check, potentially allowing a connection without proper verification.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability involves reuse of SSL session IDs during network connections to the same hostname. The attacker would exploit this over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
The attacker must cause a failed OCSP stapling verification and then reuse the session ID. This requires some conditions but no special environment or timing constraints are mentioned.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
No privileges are needed to trigger this; the attacker just needs to connect to the service.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
No user interaction is required; the attacker can exploit this by making network connections.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
The vulnerability affects the same component (curl's SSL session cache and verification). There is no indication that the impact crosses privilege boundaries or affects other components.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Skipping the OCSP verification could allow an attacker to impersonate a server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially exposing sensitive data. This implies some confidentiality impact, but not total data disclosure.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
By skipping verification, an attacker could inject or modify data in the communication, affecting integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
No indication that availability is affected.  
- **Value:** None (N)

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's i2c subsystem.
- Issue arises from improper validation of user data in a compatibility ioctl.
- Wrong user data can cause warnings in i2c_transfer(), e.g., zero messages.
- The patch adds validation to prevent userspace from triggering warnings.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by userspace sending malformed data via ioctl.  
- Ioctl calls are local to the machine (not over the network).  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is caused by sending malformed data (e.g., zero messages) via ioctl.  
- This does not require any special conditions or timing; just malformed input.  
- So, the attack complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by userspace calling an ioctl.  
- Usually, ioctl calls to kernel drivers require some privileges.  
- However, the description does not specify if root or elevated privileges are required.  
- Typically, i2c device ioctl calls require at least some privileges (often root or group membership).  
- Since it is a kernel ioctl, likely **High (H)** privileges are required.  
- But if the device is accessible to unprivileged users, it could be Low or None.  
- Given typical Linux kernel device access, let's assume **Low (L)** privileges required (e.g., user in i2c group).  
- If no info, conservative choice is Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user triggering the vulnerability is the one sending the malformed ioctl.  
- No other user interaction is required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes warnings in i2c_transfer(), but no indication that it affects other components beyond the kernel subsystem.  
- No indication that the vulnerability causes impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions warnings caused by malformed data, no mention of data disclosure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data is modified or corrupted.  
- Only warnings are triggered.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Warnings may cause some disruption or instability, but no explicit mention of denial of service or crash.  
- Warnings alone usually do not cause availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6 × (1 - 1) = 0

Since Impact = 0, Base Score = 0 (no impact).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Directory Traversal vulnerability in Kihron ServerRPExposer v.1.0.2 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the loadServerPack in ServerResourcePackProviderMixin.java.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows a **remote attacker** to execute arbitrary code. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit the vulnerability. Directory traversal and arbitrary code execution typically have low complexity if no special conditions are mentioned.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and no mention of needing any privileges. This suggests no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of needing user interaction. The attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely, so likely no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which usually means the attacker can affect resources beyond their initial privileges or component boundaries. This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution typically allows full access to data, so confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the system, so availability impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attacker, network accessible                                       |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions mentioned                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required                                                    |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                              |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####42#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"In mp3 decoder, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a race condition. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation."

---

### Step 1: Attack Vector (AV)  
- The vulnerability is in an mp3 decoder, which typically processes files that could be received over a network (e.g., downloaded or streamed).  
- The description says "remote escalation of privilege," implying the attacker can exploit it remotely.  
- Therefore, **Attack Vector = Network (N)**.

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)  
- The vulnerability is due to a race condition, which generally requires precise timing and conditions to exploit.  
- Race conditions usually increase complexity.  
- Therefore, **Attack Complexity = High (H)**.

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)  
- The description says "no additional execution privileges needed," meaning the attacker does not need any privileges before exploitation.  
- Therefore, **Privileges Required = None (N)**.

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)  
- The description states "User interaction is needed for exploitation."  
- Therefore, **User Interaction = Required (R)**.

### Step 5: Scope (S)  
- The vulnerability leads to "escalation of privilege," which means the impact crosses privilege boundaries within the same system.  
- Escalation of privilege typically means the scope is **Changed (C)** because the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Scope = Changed (C)**.

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)  
- The description does not mention data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- Out of bounds write and privilege escalation usually affect integrity and availability more than confidentiality.  
- Therefore, **Confidentiality = None (N)**.

### Step 7: Integrity (I)  
- The vulnerability is an out of bounds write leading to privilege escalation, which implies the attacker can modify data or code.  
- This is a high impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, **Integrity = High (H)**.

### Step 8: Availability (A)  
- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.  
- Therefore, **Availability = None (N)**.

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Remote exploitation possible over network      |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Race condition increases complexity            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | User interaction required                       |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Privilege escalation changes scope              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N     | No confidentiality impact                       |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Out of bounds write leads to high integrity impact |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact                          |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:H (0.44)  
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:C  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.197  
≈ 1.62

**Impact Subscore:**  
Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact Subscore = 7.52 × (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.56 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.56 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.531 - 3.25 × (0.54)^15  
= 3.99 - 3.25 × very small number  
≈ 3.99 (since (0.54)^15 is very small)

**Base Score:**  
= min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= min(3.99 + 1.62, 10)  
= 5.61

Rounded to one decimal place: **5.6**

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N**

#####43#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem.  
- Causes a NULL pointer dereference (crash) due to improper handling of program attachment parameters.  
- Triggered by a sequence of loading BPF programs and creating tracing links with missing or incorrect parameters.  
- Results in a denial of service (kernel crash).  
- The issue is triggered via system calls (bpf syscall).  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by user-space programs invoking the bpf syscall.  
- The syscall interface is accessible locally on the machine (not remotely over the network).  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The exploit requires a specific sequence of loading BPF programs and creating tracing links with particular parameters (e.g., missing target_fd).  
- This is somewhat complex but does not require unusual conditions beyond crafted input.  
- The complexity is **Low (L)** because the attacker can control the inputs and trigger the crash reliably.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The bpf syscall generally requires elevated privileges (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) to load and attach BPF programs.  
- Therefore, the attacker must have **High (H)** privileges.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker directly invokes the syscall; no other user interaction is needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (denial of service) but does not appear to affect other components beyond the kernel itself.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (kernel).  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No indication of data disclosure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication of data modification or corruption beyond crash.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The kernel crash causes denial of service.  
- This is a **High (H)** impact on availability.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric                 | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)     | L     | Local syscall interface                         |
| Attack Complexity (AC) | L     | Low complexity, attacker controls inputs       |
| Privileges Required (PR) | H   | Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges               |
| User Interaction (UI)  | N     | No user interaction needed                       |
| Scope (S)              | U     | Impact limited to kernel scope                   |
| Confidentiality (C)    | N     | No data disclosure                               |
| Integrity (I)          | N     | No integrity impact                              |
| Availability (A)       | H     | Kernel crash causes high availability impact    |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 * 0.77 = 3.482  
3.482 * 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 * 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 0.799, 10))  
= round_up(4.394)  
= 4.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####44#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in /admin/ component (Admin Login)
- Impact: Critical
- Attack vector: The attack may be launched remotely.
- Attack complexity: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection typically requires low complexity.
- Privileges required: Not stated, but since it is an admin login page, likely no privileges required before attack.
- User interaction: Not stated, but SQL injection attacks generally do not require user interaction.
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection typically affects the same scope (application).
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: SQL injection can lead to data disclosure, data modification, and possibly denial of service.

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  "The attack may be launched remotely."  
  This implies Network (N).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL injection is generally straightforward if input is not sanitized, so Low (L).

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attack is on the login page and involves username/password parameters, the attacker likely does not need any privileges beforehand. So None (N).

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker directly manipulates input parameters; no user interaction required. So None (N).

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same component (Admin Login) and does not indicate impact beyond the vulnerable component. So Unchanged (U).

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL injection can lead to data disclosure. Given the critical rating, assume High (H).

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL injection can allow data modification. Assume High (H).

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL injection can cause denial of service or data deletion. Assume High (H).

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack launched remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | SQL injection is low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to exploit |

#####45#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in ZhongFuCheng3y Austin 1.0
- Affects function getFile in MaterialController.java
- Issue: Unrestricted upload (likely allows uploading arbitrary files)
- Exploit is publicly disclosed
- Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves uploading files via a web controller, which implies remote exploitation over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description states "unrestricted upload," implying no special conditions or environment needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since the vulnerability is in a web controller's upload function and no mention of needing authentication or privileges, it likely requires no privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker uploads files directly; no mention of needing a user to perform any action.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the upload functionality, which likely impacts the web server or application beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Uploading arbitrary files can lead to code execution or other impacts outside the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, scope is likely **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unrestricted upload primarily affects integrity and availability, but could also lead to confidentiality breaches if attacker uploads malicious files to access data.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
- Assign **Low (L)** to confidentiality impact as a conservative estimate.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Uploading arbitrary files can modify or add files, impacting integrity.  
- Likely **High (H)** impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Uploading files could lead to denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but unrestricted upload can cause availability issues.  
- Assign **Low (L)** impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible upload function |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L

#####46#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
D-Link Go-RT-AC750 GORTAC750_A1_FW_v101b03 contains a stack-based buffer overflow via the function genacgi_main. This vulnerability allows attackers to enable telnet service via a specially crafted payload.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted payload, likely sent over the network to the device.  
- Since this is a network device and the payload is crafted to exploit a function (genacgi_main), it is reasonable to assume the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by a crafted payload.  
- No mention of any special conditions or environment needed.  
- Usually, buffer overflow exploits with crafted payloads are considered low complexity unless otherwise stated.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker enables telnet service via the crafted payload.  
- This suggests the attacker does not need prior authentication or privileges to send the payload.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted payload to the device.  
- No mention of requiring a user to perform any action (like clicking a link).  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows enabling telnet service, which is a configuration change on the device.  
- The buffer overflow occurs in the device firmware, and the impact is on the same security authority (the device itself).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Enabling telnet service could allow an attacker to connect and potentially access sensitive information.  
- However, the description only mentions enabling telnet, not direct data disclosure.  
- The buffer overflow itself might allow code execution, but the description focuses on enabling telnet.  
- Enabling telnet could lead to some information disclosure, but not necessarily high.  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Enabling telnet service allows an attacker to potentially modify device settings or firmware via telnet.  
- This implies some level of integrity impact.  
- Since the attacker can enable telnet, which could lead to full control, this could be considered high.  
- However, the description only explicitly mentions enabling telnet, not full control.  
- Given the buffer overflow, code execution is likely, so integrity impact is high.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Enabling telnet service does not directly imply availability impact.  
- The buffer overflow could cause crashes, but the description does not mention denial of service.  
- So, availability impact is likely none.  
- **A = None (N)**

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.3432 = 0.6568

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(8.10) = 8.1 → 8.1 rounds to 8.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

#####47#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
IBM Operational Decision Manager 8.10.3, 8.10.4, 8.10.5.1, 8.11, 8.11.0.1, 8.11.1 and 8.12.0.1 is susceptible to remote code execution attack via JNDI injection when passing an unchecked argument to a certain API.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is described as "remote code execution" via JNDI injection through an API. This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack involves passing an unchecked argument to an API, which suggests no special conditions or environment are required beyond normal usage. This indicates low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges. Since it is a remote code execution via an API, it likely requires no privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack is via an API call, no mention of requiring user interaction (like clicking a link or opening a file).  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Remote code execution typically allows the attacker to execute code outside the security scope of the vulnerable component, potentially affecting other components or the system. Usually, RCE changes scope.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Remote code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  RCE allows arbitrary code execution, so integrity is fully compromised.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  RCE can also lead to denial of service or system disruption.  
  **Value:** High (H)

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Remote network attack via API                                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                                               |
| Scope (S)            | C     | RCE likely changes scope beyond vulnerable component                       |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Full data disclosure possible                                              |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Full integrity compromise possible                                        |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Full availability impact possible                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85 ≈ 3.89

2. Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 × 0.915 ≈ 6.88

3. Since Scope is Changed:  
Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 3.89, 10])  
= Roundup (10.77, 10)  
= 10.0 (max score)

#####49#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in BIOVIA Materials Studio products from Release BIOVIA 2021 through Release BIOVIA 2023. Upload of a specially crafted perl script can lead to arbitrary command execution."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a specially crafted perl script. Uploading a file typically requires network access (e.g., via a web interface). Since the attacker can upload the script remotely, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Uploading a crafted script is straightforward if the upload functionality is available. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker uploads a script to execute commands. Usually, uploading files is possible without privileges or with low privileges. The description does not mention needing any privileges. Assume **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention that a user must perform any action for the exploit to succeed. The attacker uploads the script and executes commands. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to arbitrary command execution on the system. If the exploited component and the impacted component are the same, scope is **Unchanged (U)**. If the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component, scope is **Changed (C)**.  
  Since the description does not mention privilege escalation beyond the component or impact on other components, assume **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can lead to full data disclosure. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary command execution allows full modification of data. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can disrupt or deny service. So, **High (H)**.

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####50#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability involves **enabled but unsecured management endpoints** in the Micronaut Framework.
- These endpoints are susceptible to **drive-by localhost attacks**.
- A malicious website can make HTTP requests to `localhost` from the victim's browser.
- Normally, CORS preflight checks would block such requests, but some "simple" requests bypass this.
- The attack is more relevant in **local development environments** where endpoints are enabled without security.
- Production environments typically disable or secure these endpoints.
- The attack vector is from a **remote attacker via the victim's browser** making requests to localhost.
- The attacker does **not** have direct network access to the victim's machine but exploits the victim's browser to make requests to localhost.
- The impact is on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the local application endpoints.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The attacker is remote, using a malicious website to make HTTP requests to `localhost`.
- The attack is performed **over the network** (via the victim's browser).
- Although the target is localhost, the attacker does not have local access; the attack is initiated remotely.
- **AV = Network (N)**

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The attack requires the victim to visit a malicious website.
- The attack relies on "simple" HTTP requests that do not trigger CORS preflight.
- No special conditions or complex steps are required beyond visiting a malicious site.
- **AC = Low (L)**

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the victim's machine.
- The attacker only needs the victim to visit a malicious website.
- **PR = None (N)**

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The victim must visit a malicious website (user interaction required).
- The attack cannot happen without user interaction.
- **UI = Required (R)**

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope: the localhost endpoints on the victim's machine.
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

#### Confidentiality (C)
- The attacker can trigger management endpoints on localhost.
- This may allow reading sensitive information exposed by these endpoints.
- The description implies some information disclosure is possible.
- **C = Low (L)**

#### Integrity (I)
- The attacker can trigger endpoints, potentially modifying state or configuration.
- The description implies some level of impact on integrity.
- **I = Low (L)**

#### Availability (A)
- The attacker can trigger endpoints, possibly causing denial of service or disruption.
- The description implies some impact on availability.
- **A = Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network via victim's browser |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, simple HTTP requests |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must visit malicious website |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same security scope |
| C      | L     | Some information disclosure possible |
| I      | L     | Some modification possible |
| A      | L     | Some disruption possible |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

- Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))
- = 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)
- = 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)
- = 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**

- If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0
- Else, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

- Base Score = round_up(min(3.38 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(6.20) = 6.2

Rounded to one decimal place: **6.2**

#####52#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in FreeFloat FTP Server 1.0
- Affects the SIZE Command Handler
- Leads to Denial of Service (DoS)
- Attack can be launched remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The attack can be launched remotely.  
   - FTP is a network service, so the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - No indication of special conditions or complexity; the exploit is publicly disclosed and presumably straightforward.  
   - Therefore, **Low (L)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
   - Likely **None (N)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - No mention that user interaction is required for the attack.  
   - The attacker can launch the attack remotely without user help.  
   - So, **None (N)**.

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability causes denial of service in the same component (SIZE Command Handler of the FTP server).  
   - No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components.  
   - So, **Unchanged (U)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - The vulnerability leads to denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
   - So, **None (N)**.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
   - So, **None (N)**.

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - The vulnerability causes denial of service, which impacts availability.  
   - The severity is not specified, but DoS usually at least causes **Low (L)** or **High (H)** impact.  
   - Since the description says "denial of service" without further detail, and the exploit is public, assume **High (H)** availability impact.

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####53#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: XWiki Platform
- Vulnerability: A user who can attach a file to a page can post a malformed TAR file with manipulated file modification time headers.
- Impact: When parsed by Tika, this causes a denial of service (DoS) via CPU consumption.
- Attack vector: The attacker must be a user able to attach a file to a page.
- Impact type: Denial of service (availability impact).
- No mention of confidentiality or integrity impact.
- No mention of user interaction beyond the attacker attaching a file.
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing the file (likely automatic or by other users).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be able to attach a file to a page.  
- This implies the attacker has some level of access to the application, but the attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- Since the attacker can interact with the application over the network (web interface), the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must craft a malformed TAR file with manipulated modification time headers.  
- This requires some knowledge but no special conditions or timing constraints are mentioned.  
- The complexity is low because the attacker just needs to upload a malformed file.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be "a user able to attach a file to a page."  
- This implies some privileges are required (not anonymous).  
- The privilege level is likely **Low (L)** because the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with file attachment rights, but not admin or high privileges.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker uploads the file themselves.  
- No other user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a denial of service in the same component (XWiki platform parsing the file).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No confidentiality impact is described.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No integrity impact is described.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Denial of service via CPU consumption is an availability impact.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system shutdown.  
- Since the description says "denial of service," we assume **High (H)** availability impact.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(6.28) = 6.3

#####54#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Memory corruption while running NPU, when NETWORK_UNLOAD and (NETWORK_UNLOAD or NETWORK_EXECUTE_V2) commands are submitted at the same time."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The issue occurs when commands are submitted simultaneously.  
- The commands are NETWORK_UNLOAD and NETWORK_EXECUTE_V2, which suggests network-related commands.  
- Since the commands are submitted remotely over a network interface, the attack vector is likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires submitting two specific commands at the same time.  
- This is a specific condition but not necessarily difficult for an attacker who knows the commands.  
- Since it requires a specific timing condition but no special environment or conditions, this is likely **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not specify if the attacker needs any privileges to submit these commands.  
- Since the commands are NETWORK_UNLOAD and NETWORK_EXECUTE_V2, which sound like privileged commands, but the description does not clarify.  
- Assuming these commands can be submitted by an unprivileged user or attacker (e.g., remote attacker), we choose **None (N)**.  
- If these commands require authentication, PR would be Low or High, but no info is given, so default to None.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack involves submitting commands; no mention of user interaction required.  
- Likely **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Memory corruption in the NPU (Neural Processing Unit) suggests impact is within the same security scope (e.g., same component or system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
- Without explicit info, assume **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality (some data may be exposed).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can allow modification of data or code.  
- Likely **High (H)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Likely **High (H)** impact on availability.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.151 = 0.849

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(9.36) = 9.4

#####55#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is in Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py).
- It involves verification of W3C Format Verifiable Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs.
- The verification result of the presentation `document.proof` was not factored into the final `verified` value.
- This allows holders to present incorrectly constructed proofs.
- Malicious verifiers can save and replay a presentation from holders as their own.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The flaw involves presenting verifiable credentials and replaying presentations.  
- Since this involves sending/verifying data over a network (verifiers and holders communicate), the attack can be performed remotely over a network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft incorrectly constructed proofs or replay presentations.  
- No indication that this requires special conditions or timing.  
- The flaw is due to logic error in verification, so complexity is low.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is a holder or malicious verifier.  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system running ACA-Py; they just need to present or replay credentials.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack involves presenting or replaying credentials.  
- No indication that a user must perform any action for the attack to succeed.  
- The attacker controls the presentation.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the verification logic within ACA-Py.  
- The impact is on the same security authority (the verification process).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The flaw allows replaying presentations as their own, but does it expose confidential information?  
- The description does not mention disclosure of confidential data.  
- The attacker can impersonate a holder but not necessarily gain new confidential info.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can present incorrectly constructed proofs and replay presentations as their own.  
- This means the integrity of the verification process is compromised (false positives).  
- This is a direct impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- **A = None (N)**

| AV     | N     | Attack can be performed remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |

- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 0.44 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (3.5952 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (7.4852)  
= 7.5

#####56#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Dell BIOS contains a Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user with admin privileges could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is a local user (local authenticated malicious user).  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No indication of special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to be local and authenticated. Usually, local exploits are low complexity unless stated otherwise.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated with admin privileges. Admin privileges are typically considered High privileges.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker is the one exploiting the vulnerability directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the BIOS, which is part of the system firmware. Exploiting it leads to denial of service, but no indication that the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from BIOS to OS or vice versa). Usually, BIOS vulnerabilities affect the same scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No mention of confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of integrity impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability can lead to denial of service. Denial of service impacts availability. The severity is not specified as partial or complete, but DOS usually is Low or High depending on impact. BIOS denial of service can be severe (e.g., system unbootable). Given the admin privileges and BIOS level, this is likely High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | H     | Requires admin privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service (high impact) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 * 0.77 = 3.481  
3.481 * 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 * 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 * 1 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged):**  
Impact = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.595

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 0.799, 10))  
= round_up(4.394)  
= 4.4

#####57#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Kashipara Food Management System up to 1.0.
- Affects processing of the file party_submit.php.
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the argument party_address.
- The attack may be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Rated as "problematic" (not explicitly critical or high severity).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- XSS typically can be exploited over the network (e.g., via a web request).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities usually require low complexity to exploit, especially if the input is directly reflected or stored without proper sanitization.  
- No mention of any special conditions or complex steps.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument in a web request.  
- Usually, XSS does not require any privileges; anyone can send a crafted request.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For XSS, the attacker usually needs the victim user to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a crafted URL or view a page).  
- So, user interaction is required.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user or session hijacking.  
- Usually, the impact on confidentiality is Low (L) because it can expose some data but not full system data.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that may modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically considered Low (L) impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N).

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####58#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to send malicious network requests containing arbitrary client-side script code and obtain its execution inside a victim’s session via a crafted URL, HTTP request, or simply by waiting for the victim to view the poisoned log."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and sends malicious network requests or crafted URLs. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to send crafted requests or wait for the victim to view the poisoned log. No special conditions or timing are mentioned. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must view the poisoned log or interact with the crafted URL for the script to execute. This means user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability results in execution inside the victim’s session, but there is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes the security scope. It appears the impact is limited to the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can execute arbitrary client-side script code inside the victim’s session, which can lead to data disclosure or theft. This is at least a low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Execution of arbitrary script code can modify data or perform unauthorized actions, implying some impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  There is no mention of disruption or denial of service.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |

| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     |

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.68) = Roundup(5.19) = 5.2

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####59#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow in Delta Electronics DOPSoft when parsing a specific field in a DPS file.  
- Exploitation: Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file.  
- Impact: Remote code execution (implies full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability).  

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The attacker must entice a user to open a malicious file. The attack requires the user to open a file locally, so the attacker cannot exploit it purely over the network without user interaction.  
   - The file is local to the victim machine, so the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted DPS file, but no additional conditions or environment requirements are mentioned.  
   - This is a straightforward buffer overflow triggered by opening a file, so **Low (L)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - The attacker is unauthenticated and does not require any privileges on the victim system before exploitation.  
   - So, **None (N)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - The user must open the malicious DPS file, so user interaction is required.  
   - **Required (R)**.

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability leads to remote code execution within the same software/process. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
   - So, **Unchanged (U)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C):**

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a URL, but no special conditions or timing are required.  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient encoding, which is straightforward to exploit.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends the URL to an authenticated user, so the victim must be authenticated.  
- The attacker themselves does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must have privileges (authenticated user).  
- According to CVSS, PR is about the attacker’s privileges, not the victim’s.  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must convince the user to click or visit the crafted URL.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N**

---

### Step 4: Calculate Base Score (Optional)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44) = 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.68 + 3.59) = Roundup(6.27) = 6.3

**Severity:** Medium

#####61#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Trend Micro Mobile Security (Enterprise) could allow an exploit against an authenticated victim that visits a malicious link provided by an attacker.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by the victim visiting a malicious link, which implies the attack is conducted over the network (e.g., via a web request).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS typically requires no special conditions beyond the victim clicking a malicious link. No complex conditions or environment needed.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker exploits the vulnerability against an authenticated victim, meaning the victim must be logged in. The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must have some privileges (authenticated user). For CVSS, PR refers to the attacker’s privileges on the vulnerable component. Since the attacker is remote and does not have privileges on the system, but the victim must be authenticated, this is considered **Low (L)** privileges required.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must visit a malicious link, so user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Reflected XSS typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, so it impacts confidentiality to some extent. Usually, this is considered Low (L) because it does not directly disclose all data.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, so integrity is impacted at a low level.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N → 0.85  
- AC:L → 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) → 0.62  
- UI:R → 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L → 0.22  
- I:L → 0.22  
- A:N → 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.04

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.04) = round_up(4.55) = 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####62#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
"In Engineer Mode, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires local access ("local escalation of privilege"). So, the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check, which is straightforward.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which implies the attacker must already have high privileges to exploit this.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to local escalation of privilege but does not indicate that the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from one component to another). The scope remains unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  An out of bounds write can modify memory, which affects integrity. Since it leads to privilege escalation, the integrity impact is high.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | L     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| H   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(4.38) = 4.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely over the network.  
- AV:N (Network)

- UI:R (Required)

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS usually affects the same security scope (the web application itself).  
- S:U (Unchanged)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).

- Usually Low impact unless full control is possible.  
- I:L (Low)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####64#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability: Use-after-free in the Linux kernel's DRM bridge subsystem (pmic_glink_altmode driver).
- Impact: Causes display subsystem initialization failures and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot.
- Attack scenario: Race condition during probe deferral leads to use-after-free.
- Affects: Lenovo ThinkPad X13s and potentially other devices using this driver.
- Exploitation: Happens during boot, triggered by kernel driver behavior.
- Fix: Change bridge registration order to avoid use-after-free.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel driver, triggered during device probe and initialization.
- Exploitation requires interaction with the device at boot time.
- The issue is local to the machine; it cannot be exploited remotely over a network.
- No indication that an adjacent network or physical access is required.
- The attacker must have local access to the system (e.g., ability to reboot or load kernel modules).
  
**Value:** Local (L)

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The issue arises due to a race condition during probe deferral.
- Race conditions are generally considered to have **High** complexity because they require precise timing.
- However, this is a kernel driver bug triggered during boot, which might be deterministic.
- But since it involves a race window and timing, it is safer to consider **High** complexity.

**Value:** High (H)

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- The vulnerability is in the kernel during device initialization.
- To trigger this, an attacker would need to cause the kernel to load or reload the driver or reboot the system.
- This implies the attacker needs at least some privileges on the system.
- Kernel driver loading usually requires **High** privileges (root).
- So, **High** privileges required.

**Value:** High (H)

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The vulnerability occurs during boot or driver probe.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability once the system boots or the driver loads.
- The attacker triggers it by causing the system to boot or reload the driver, no additional user interaction needed.

**Value:** None (N)

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability affects the kernel subsystem.
- The impact is on the kernel's internal data structures and potentially causes NULL pointer dereferences and system crashes.
- The vulnerability causes a change in the kernel's behavior but does not appear to affect other components beyond the kernel.
- The scope remains within the kernel (same security authority).

**Value:** Unchanged (U)

#### Confidentiality (C)
- The vulnerability causes use-after-free and NULL pointer dereferences.
- No indication that confidentiality of data is compromised.
- No data leakage described.

**Value:** None (N)

#### Integrity (I)
- The vulnerability causes kernel crashes or failures in display initialization.
- No indication that attacker can modify data or code.
- Use-after-free could potentially lead to code execution, but no explicit mention.
- Since the description focuses on crashes and NULL dereferences, integrity impact is likely **None**.

**Value:** None (N)

#### Availability (A)
- The vulnerability causes failures in display initialization and kernel NULL pointer dereferences.
- This can lead to system instability or denial of service (DoS).
- So, availability is impacted at least to a **Low** degree (system may crash or fail to boot properly).

**Value:** Low (L)

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning Summary |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger during boot/driver load |
| AC     | H     | Race condition with timing requirements |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges to load kernel driver |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed after triggering |
| S      | U     | Impact confined to kernel scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Causes system instability/DoS (low impact) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:H (0.27) [since Scope=Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.0557 ≈ 0.457

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.4124

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

= round_up(min(1.4124 + 0.457, 10))  
= round_up(1.8694)  
= 1.9 (rounded to 1 decimal place)

#####65#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"In video decoder, there is a possible out of bounds read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a video decoder, which typically processes files locally. The description does not mention remote exploitation or network access.  
  Likely **Local (L)** because the attacker needs to provide a crafted input file locally.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The issue is an out of bounds read due to improper input validation. Usually, such bugs are straightforward to exploit if the attacker can supply the input. No mention of special conditions.  
  Likely **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  "No additional execution privileges needed" suggests the attacker does not need any privileges beyond what is required to run the video decoder.  
  Likely **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Since the attacker must supply a crafted input file to the video decoder, the user must open or play the malicious file. This requires user interaction.  
  Likely **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to a local denial of service (DoS) in the video decoder process. There is no indication that the impact extends beyond the vulnerable component or affects other components.  
  Likely **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The issue is an out of bounds read, but the description only mentions denial of service, not information disclosure.  
  **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption.  
  **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  The impact is a local denial of service. This affects availability.  
  Likely **Low (L)** or **High (H)**?  
  Since it is a local DoS and no mention of complete system crash or persistent DoS, **Low (L)** is appropriate.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local file input required |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | N     | No privileges needed |

| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Local DoS impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22  
= 1.32

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.15)  
= 3.2

#####66#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth in {conn,adv}_{min,max}_interval_set() function. This can result in I2cap connection or broadcast abnormality issue, possibly leading to denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem.  
- Bluetooth communication typically occurs over wireless radio, which is considered an Adjacent network (A) because the attacker must be within Bluetooth range (not over the internet).  
- Therefore, AV = Adjacent (A).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a race condition, which usually requires precise timing but no special conditions beyond that.  
- Race conditions are often considered Low complexity if no special environment or conditions are needed.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel Bluetooth stack.  
- To exploit a kernel race condition in Bluetooth, an attacker typically does not need privileges on the system; they can be a remote attacker within Bluetooth range.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.  
- The attacker can trigger the issue by sending crafted Bluetooth packets.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem.  
- The impact is on the same component (kernel Bluetooth stack), no indication that it affects other components or security authorities.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions connection or broadcast abnormality, no mention of data disclosure.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality impact = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- The issue causes abnormal behavior or denial of service, not integrity loss.  
- Therefore, Integrity impact = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- The description explicitly mentions possible denial of service.  
- Denial of service is an availability impact.  
- The severity is not specified, but "abnormality" and "possibly leading to denial of service" suggests at least a Low impact.  
- Given the kernel-level DoS, it is reasonable to assign High (H) availability impact.  
- Therefore, Availability impact = High (H).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability sub-score:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.345  
≈ 2.84

**Impact sub-score:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.84 + 3.5952)  
= Round_up (6.4352)  
= 6.5

#####67#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The WP VR WordPress plugin before 8.3.15 does not have authorization and is vulnerable to CSRF in a function hooked to admin_init, allowing unauthenticated users to downgrade the plugin, which leads to reflected or stored XSS vulnerabilities.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users remotely (via CSRF, which is a web-based attack). Since the attack is performed over the network (web request), AV = **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request (CSRF). CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be authenticated and visit a malicious site, but here it says "unauthenticated users" can exploit it, which is unusual for CSRF. However, since the function is hooked to admin_init, and the attacker is unauthenticated, it implies no complex conditions. So, AC = **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "allowing unauthenticated users" to downgrade the plugin. So, no privileges are required. PR = **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  CSRF attacks require the victim to perform some action, like visiting a malicious page. However, here it says "unauthenticated users" can exploit it, which suggests no user interaction is needed from the victim (the attacker acts directly). But CSRF by definition requires user interaction. Since the attacker is unauthenticated and can trigger the downgrade, it suggests no user interaction is needed from the victim. So, UI = **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows downgrading the plugin, which leads to reflected or stored XSS. The initial vulnerability is in the plugin, but the impact is on the WordPress site (same security authority). The scope is likely **Unchanged (U)** because the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the WordPress site).

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability leads to reflected or stored XSS, which can be used to steal cookies or sensitive information. So, confidentiality impact is **Low (L)** or possibly **High (H)** depending on the impact. Since the description does not specify full data disclosure, but XSS can lead to data theft, we assign **Low (L)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Downgrading the plugin modifies the plugin version, which is an integrity impact. Also, XSS can be used to modify content or perform actions. So, integrity impact is at least **Low (L)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact. So, **None (N)**.

---

### Summary of metrics:

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: L (Low)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 2: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(6.42) = 6.4

- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by submitting malicious input that is stored and later executed in the victim's browser.  
- The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via web interface).  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- No indication that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, stored XSS can be exploited by unauthenticated users.  
**Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim to view the malicious content (e.g., visit a page with the stored XSS).  
- So, user interaction is required.  
**Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application and its users).  
- The impact is on the confidentiality and integrity of the victim's browser session, but the vulnerable component and impacted component are within the same scope.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning Summary                                  |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network             |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploitation                       |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                               |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must view malicious content                 |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact within the same security scope              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Partial confidentiality loss (data theft)          |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Partial integrity loss (arbitrary script execution)|
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                              |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[2.51 + 2.68, 10])  
= Roundup(5.19)  
= 5.2 (Medium severity)

#####69#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in add-category.php (manipulation of the argument category)
- Affected software: PHPGurukul Dairy Farm Shop Management System up to 1.1
- Severity: Critical
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- SQL Injection typically can be exploited remotely over the network if the vulnerable parameter is accessible via a web interface.  
- Since this is a web application vulnerability, the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the input is directly injectable without additional conditions.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument (category) in add-category.php, which is likely accessible without authentication or with minimal privileges.  
- The description does not mention the need for authentication or privileges.  
- Assume no privileges required.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker directly sends a crafted request to the vulnerable parameter.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection affects the database, which is a different security authority than the web application itself.  
- Exploiting SQL Injection can lead to impact beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., database compromise).  
- This means the scope is changed.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since the vulnerability is critical and publicly disclosed, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- This is a critical impact.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can also lead to denial of service or data deletion.  
- Given the critical rating, assume high availability impact.  
- **A = High (H)**

#####70#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
LlamaIndex (aka llama_index) through 0.9.34 allows SQL injection via the Text-to-SQL feature in several query engines. An attacker might be able to delete data (e.g., student records) by injecting malicious SQL commands through English language input.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted input (English language input) to the application.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over a network (e.g., via an API or web interface).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to provide malicious input in natural language to trigger SQL injection.  
- No special conditions or environment required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges.  
- The attacker can inject SQL via input, presumably without authentication.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends input directly; no other user needs to interact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows modification of data (deleting student records) within the same security scope (the database accessed by the application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL injection can lead to data disclosure, but the example focuses on deletion.  
- However, SQL injection typically allows reading data as well.  
- Given the description focuses on deletion, but SQL injection usually impacts confidentiality at least to some extent.  
- To be conservative, assign **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can delete records, which is a modification of data.  
- This is a **High (H)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- Deleting records can impact availability of data.  
- However, availability impact is usually considered **Low (L)** unless the entire system is taken down.  
- Here, deleting some records impacts availability partially.  
- Assign **Low (L)** availability impact.

#####71#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Tenda W9 1.0.0.7(4456), critical severity.
- Affects function formQosManage_user in httpd component.
- Manipulation of argument ssidIndex leads to stack-based buffer overflow.
- Attack may be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and usable.
- Vendor did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- "The attack may be initiated remotely."
- The vulnerable component is httpd (web server), so the attacker can exploit over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument (ssidIndex).
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.
- Usually, buffer overflow via argument manipulation is straightforward.
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely.
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.
- Likely no privileges required.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention that user interaction is required.
- The attacker can send a crafted request to httpd.
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is in the httpd component.
- Stack-based buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.
- Usually, buffer overflow in a service can lead to privilege escalation or impact other components.
- However, no explicit mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Since the vulnerability is in a component of the same security authority (httpd), and no mention of privilege escalation or impact beyond the component, assume scope is unchanged.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution.
- No explicit mention of data disclosure.
- However, code execution can lead to data compromise.
- Given critical classification and buffer overflow, assume at least Low confidentiality impact.
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**

- Buffer overflow can allow attacker to execute arbitrary code, modify data.
- So integrity is impacted.
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**

- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.
- So availability is impacted.
- **A = High (H)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

**Impact Subscore:**

- ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]

= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]

= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Apache Kylin versions 2.0.0 to 4.0.3.
- Server Config web interface displays content of `kylin.properties`, which may contain server-side credentials.
- When the service runs over HTTP (unencrypted), network sniffers can hijack the HTTP payload and access sensitive content.
- Recommendations include enabling HTTPS, avoiding plaintext credentials, using firewalls, or upgrading to 4.0.4.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by sniffing network traffic over HTTP.  
- The attacker can be anywhere on the network path (e.g., on the same network or anywhere on the internet if no firewall).  
- This implies **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must be able to sniff network traffic.  
- This requires the attacker to be in a position to intercept traffic (e.g., on the same LAN or able to perform MITM).  
- This is not trivial but also not very complex; sniffing network traffic is a common attack but requires some access.  
- Usually, sniffing unencrypted HTTP traffic is considered **Low (L)** complexity because no special conditions beyond network access are needed.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system.  
- They only need to sniff network traffic.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is passively sniffing traffic; no user interaction is required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information (credentials) but does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The impact is on confidentiality of the server config file.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or security domains.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can obtain sensitive credentials from the file.  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.  
- The description suggests full disclosure of credentials, so **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability does not allow modification of data, only reading.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No impact on availability is described.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 3.84, 10)) = round_up(7.44) = 7.4 → 7.4 rounds to 7.4 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.345 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) — since Scope is Changed, PR:N = 0.85
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 × (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.3916 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.3916 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.3626 - 3.25 × (0.3716)^15  
= 2.726 - 3.25 × very small number  
≈ 2.726 (since (0.3716)^15 is negligible)

**Base Score:**  
If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, if Scope is Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × (2.726 + 2.83), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × 5.556, 10))  
= round_up(min(6.0, 10))  
= 6.0

#####77#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the argument `res_id` in `dishes.php`.
- Attack Vector: The attack may be launched remotely.
- Exploit status: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Impact: XSS typically impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability to varying degrees, often low or none for availability.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely, so the attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- XSS is typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via a web request).  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS via argument manipulation is usually straightforward.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates a URL parameter (`res_id`), no mention of needing to be authenticated.  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities in public-facing parameters require no privileges.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS requires a victim user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page) to trigger the script.  
- So user interaction is required.  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually considered a low impact on confidentiality unless explicitly stated.  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a low impact on integrity.  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |

| AV     | N     | Attack can be launched remotely over the network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward attack |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to exploit |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required to trigger XSS |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U),  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability type: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Apache Superset before 3.0.3
- Attacker requirements: Authenticated attacker with create/update permissions on charts or dashboards
- Impact: Stored script or HTML snippet can be injected, leading to XSS
- User interaction: Not explicitly required for exploitation (the victim user just needs to view the stored content)
- Scope: Likely unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security scope)
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability: Typically, XSS impacts confidentiality and integrity (e.g., stealing cookies, executing scripts), but availability impact is usually none or low.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated and have permissions to create/update charts/dashboards.  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface (network accessible).  
- The attacker injects malicious content that is later executed in the victim's browser.  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to have specific permissions (create/update charts or dashboards).  
- This is a moderate requirement but not very complex once permissions are obtained.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated and have create/update permissions on charts or dashboards.  
- This is more than no privileges but less than full admin.  
- This corresponds to Low privileges.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker stores the malicious script.  
- The victim must view the stored content for the script to execute.  
- This means user interaction is required (the victim must open the page with the stored XSS).  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens).  
- This is a partial impact, not full system compromise.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow attacker to execute scripts that modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- Partial impact on integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via web interface |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, attacker just needs permissions |
| PR     | L     | Requires authenticated user with create/update permissions |
| UI     | R     | Victim must view the stored malicious content |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, no privilege escalation |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (data disclosure) |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact (script execution) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.515 + 2.068, 10))  
= round_up(4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####79#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 9.0.0.x through 9.6.0.x contains a missing authentication for critical function vulnerability. A low privileged local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated access.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is described as a "local malicious user," so the attack requires local access.  
  **AV:L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; it implies straightforward exploitation by a local user.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is a "low privileged local malicious user," so some privileges are required but not high.  
  **PR:L (Low)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required; the attacker is local and presumably can trigger the exploit themselves.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The attacker can "gain elevated access," which implies the vulnerability allows privilege escalation within the same security scope (e.g., same system). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  Usually, privilege escalation within the same system is considered **Scope: Unchanged (U)**.  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  "Gain elevated access" implies some confidentiality impact, likely at least low.  
  Since the attacker gains elevated access, they can likely access sensitive information.  
  **C:L (Low)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Elevated access usually allows modification of data or system state.  
  **I:L (Low)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A:N (None)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged (privilege escalation within same scope) |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact due to elevated access |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact due to elevated access |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 1.82) = round_up(4.33) = 4.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The Debug Log Manager WordPress plugin before 2.3.0 contains a Directory listing vulnerability which allows you to download the debug log without authorization and gain access to sensitive data.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows downloading the debug log remotely (likely over the web). Since WordPress plugins are accessed over the network, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Directory listing vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "without authorization," meaning no privileges are required. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker can download the debug log directly without requiring any user interaction. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to sensitive data within the same component (the plugin). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can gain access to sensitive data (debug logs). This is a clear confidentiality impact. The impact is likely **High (H)** because debug logs can contain sensitive information such as credentials, tokens, or system details.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The vulnerability allows reading data but does not mention modifying it. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No impact on availability is described. So, **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable over the network                    |

| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Sensitive data disclosure (debug logs)            |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                                |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                             |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.48)  
= 7.5

#####81#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Vyper compiler's IR stack management for `sha3_64`.
- The issue **cannot be triggered from regular Vyper code**; it requires manually writing the IR.
- No flow caching the key was found, so the issue is unlikely to be triggered during normal compilation.
- Impact is low.
- No patch available at the time of publication.

---

### Metric Analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the compiler internals, specifically in the IR compilation step.  
- Exploitation requires writing IR by hand, which is a local action by the user of the compiler.  
- It is not remotely exploitable over a network or adjacent network.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Exploitation requires manually writing IR, which is complex and non-trivial.  
- This is a high complexity attack.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have the ability to write or modify the IR code manually.  
- This implies the attacker has at least low privileges on the system running the compiler (e.g., user-level access).  
- No indication that high privileges (e.g., admin/root) are required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the user writing the IR manually; no other user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the compiler's internal state and output.  
- It does not affect components beyond the compiler itself (no privilege escalation or impact on other components).  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The impact is described as low and no direct data leakage is mentioned.  
- The vulnerability is about stack mismanagement in IR compilation, unlikely to cause confidentiality loss.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability could cause incorrect compilation output or miscalculation in the IR stack height.  
- This could lead to incorrect contract behavior or logic errors.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability causes denial of service or availability issues.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

### Summary of Base Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to write IR manually |
| AC     | H     | High complexity due to manual IR crafting |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges needed to write IR |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to compiler scope |

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N**

---

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for confirmation)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:H = 0.44  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.31

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(1.41 + 1.31) = round_up(2.72) = 2.7 → 3.0 (rounded to one decimal)

So the base score is approximately **3.0 (Low severity)**, consistent with the description.

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The vulnerability is exploited via local test execution, so the attacker must have local access.  
   **Value:** Local (L)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   The vulnerability arises from unsafe permissions on a temporary directory created during test execution. No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   Since the vulnerability involves local test execution, the attacker likely needs to have some privileges to run tests locally. Running tests usually requires at least low privileges (non-admin user).  
   **Value:** Low (L)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   The vulnerability occurs during test execution, which implies the user (tester) must initiate the test.  
   **Value:** Required (R)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   The vulnerability affects the same component (temporary directory permissions in the same software). No indication that the impact crosses privilege boundaries or affects other components.  
   **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   The vulnerability leads to local information disclosure. This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.162  
≈ 1.33

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.33, 10))  
= round_up(2.74)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Exposure of sensitive information (client certificate passwords) in exception logs in certain ClickHouse components when an exception occurs during database operations. This allows unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves accessing exception logs that contain sensitive information.  
- The logs are generated on the client side during database operations.  
- The attacker is described as "unauthorized users" who gain access to the logs.  
- Since the attacker must be able to trigger exceptions and access the logs, this likely requires local or adjacent access.  
- However, if the logs are accessible remotely (e.g., via network access to the client or server logs), it could be Network. But typically, exception logs are local or adjacent.  
- Given the description, it is most likely **Adjacent (A)**, assuming the attacker is on the same network or has some local access to the client or server environment to read logs.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must cause an exception to be thrown during database operations with 'sslkey' specified.  
- Causing exceptions is generally straightforward in database operations.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is "unauthorized users" who gain access to client certificate passwords via exception logs.  
- To access client exception logs, the attacker likely needs some level of access to the client machine or environment where logs are stored.  
- If the logs are accessible without any privileges, PR = None.  
- If the attacker must have some user-level access to read logs, PR = Low.  
- Since the description says "unauthorized users," implying no privileges, we assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker triggers exceptions during database operations.  
- The attacker is the one causing the exception, so no other user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects confidentiality of client certificate passwords.  
- The impact is on the same component (client or server) where the exception occurs.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Sensitive information (client certificate passwords) is exposed.  
- This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
- The exposure of passwords is a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data integrity is affected.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | A     | Attacker must be adjacent to access logs or trigger exceptions locally or on the network.  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Causing exceptions is straightforward.                                                    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(6.4152) = 6.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Use-after-free in ext4 remount function in Linux kernel.  
- Impact: Information leak (confidentiality impact).  
- Attack Vector: Local user (implies local access).  
- Privileges Required: Local user (likely low or high privileges, but since it's a local user, probably low).  
- User Interaction: Not mentioned, likely none.  
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but since it's a kernel vulnerability, it might affect kernel memory, so scope could be changed if it affects other components beyond the vulnerable component. However, since it's an information leak and local user, scope is likely unchanged.  
- Impact on Confidentiality: Information leak → Low or High? Usually information leak is Low.  
- Impact on Integrity and Availability: Not mentioned, so None.

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)  
  Because the flaw is exploitable by a local user.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  No special conditions or complexity mentioned.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)  
  The attacker is a local user, but no indication that root privileges are required. Usually, local user means low privileges.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  No mention of user interaction required.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (kernel), no indication of scope change.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "An attack has to be approached locally."  
- So, AV = Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of any special conditions or complexity.  
- Usually, if not specified, assume Low (L) for exploit disclosed and straightforward.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- Since the attack is local, but no mention of needing privileges, assume None (N).  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Assume None (N).  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- No mention of scope change.  
- Denial of Service usually affects the same component.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:L (Low)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.3061  
≈ 2.515

**Impact Sub-Score = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22  
= 1.32

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(Min(1.32 + 2.515, 10))  
= Roundup(3.835)  
= 3.8

#####89#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via shortcode attributes.
- Affected software: WordPress Button Plugin MaxButtons, versions up to 9.7.6.
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes.
- Attacker: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above.
- Impact: Inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.
- Partial fix in version 9.7.6.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed by submitting malicious shortcode attributes.
- The attacker must be authenticated and have contributor-level access.
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.
- Since the attacker can exploit this over the network (web interface), AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping.
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond contributor access.
- The attack is straightforward once the attacker has access.
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher.
- Contributor is a low-level privilege, but not none.
- According to CVSS v3.1, contributor-level access is Low privileges.
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires the attacker to inject the malicious shortcode.
- The malicious script executes when another user views the page.
- The victim user must view the page for the script to execute.
- Therefore, user interaction is required (the victim must view the page).
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of the web application.
- The impact is within the same security scope (WordPress plugin).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- This can lead to partial or full disclosure of information.
- Usually, XSS is rated as Low (L) or High (H) depending on impact.
- Since the attacker can execute arbitrary scripts, potentially stealing sensitive data, but no direct data exfiltration is mentioned, we assign Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.
- This can lead to modification of data or content.
- Integrity impact is Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.
- Availability = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network (web interface) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | L     | Requires contributor-level privileges (low) |
| UI     | R     | Requires victim user to view injected page |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible disclosure of sensitive info via script |
| I      | L     | Possible modification of content or actions |
| A      | N     | No impact on availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

Exploitability ≈ 2.07

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.515 + 2.068, 10))  
= round_up(4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####90#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the fstReaderIterBlocks2 time_table tsec_nitems functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to memory corruption. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted file. The attacker must deliver a malicious file to the victim, who then opens it locally. This implies the attack requires local access to the file (e.g., via email attachment, download, or local file system).  
  Since the attacker does not exploit this remotely over the network directly, but the victim must open the file locally, the vector is **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to craft a malicious file and have the victim open it. There are no special conditions or timing required. This is straightforward.  
  So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The victim just needs to open the file in GTKWave. No mention of needing elevated privileges.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. This requires user interaction.  
  So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to memory corruption within GTKWave. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes privileges outside the scope of the application.  
  So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Memory corruption could lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage. The impact is likely limited or uncertain.  
  Given the memory corruption, a **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality is reasonable.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Memory corruption can lead to modification of data or code execution. This suggests at least a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service. So, at least **Low (L)** impact on availability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and accesses the API over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description states the API is improperly protected and can be accessed without authentication, implying no special conditions or complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the attack.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The attacker can retrieve and modify sensitive information, which suggests impact on the same security scope (the API and its data). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can retrieve sensitive information. This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Construct CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N**

#####92#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Unsafe reflection leading to reflection injection.
- Impact: Could lead to execution of user-controlled methods and remote code execution.
- Exploitation conditions: The attacker must be logged into an account on the GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) instance with the **organization owner role**.
- Affected versions: All versions prior to 3.12.
- Reported via GitHub Bug Bounty.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network (since it involves reflection injection and remote code execution on a server).  
- The attacker must be logged in, but no physical or local access is required.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must have an account with organization owner privileges, which is a significant precondition but not necessarily complex to exploit once the attacker has those privileges.  
- The vulnerability itself is straightforward (reflection injection leading to RCE).  
- The main complexity is the requirement of a privileged account, but that is captured in PR.  
- AC is likely Low (L) because no additional complex conditions or timing are required beyond having the required privileges.  
- So, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be logged in with an **organization owner role**.  
- Organization owner is a high privilege level within GitHub Enterprise Server.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "High" privileges mean privileges that provide significant control over the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, PR = High (H).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required for exploitation.  
- The attacker is already logged in with the required privileges and can exploit the vulnerability directly.  
- So, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to remote code execution on the same system (GitHub Enterprise Server).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Remote code execution typically allows full access to the system, including reading sensitive data.  
- So, Confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Remote code execution allows an attacker to modify data or system state arbitrarily.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Remote code execution can disrupt or disable the service.  
- Availability impact is High (H).

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact is within the same security scope                                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Remote code execution leads to full confidentiality compromise                             |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Remote code execution leads to full integrity compromise                                  |

### Step 3: Construct CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

---

### Step 4: Calculate Base Score (optional, but useful)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [since Scope is Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(7.10)  
= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

**Final Base Score: 7.1 (High severity)**

---

# Final answer:

Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  
Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  
Privileges Required (PR): High (H)  
User Interaction (UI): None (N)  
Scope (S): Unchanged (U)  
Confidentiality (C): High (H)  
Integrity (I): High (H)  
Availability (A): High (H)

#####93#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The POPS! Rebel application 5.0 for Android, in POPS! Rebel Bluetooth Glucose Monitoring System, sends unencrypted glucose measurements over BLE.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability involves sending unencrypted data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE is a wireless communication technology that operates over a short range, typically considered **Adjacent (A)** because the attacker must be within Bluetooth range (usually up to 10 meters).  
  **AV = A**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is due to unencrypted data transmission. No special conditions or complex steps are mentioned. The attacker just needs to be in range to intercept the data.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs to be able to receive BLE signals; no privileges on the device or app are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required for the attack to succeed. The attacker can passively intercept data.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the confidentiality of data sent by the application. The impact is on the same system (the app/device). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Since glucose measurements are sent unencrypted, an attacker can intercept sensitive health data. This is a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description only mentions data being sent unencrypted, not that it can be modified or tampered with. No indication of integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No impact on availability is described.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | BLE communication is adjacent network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, easy to exploit |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the same scope |
| C      | H     | Sensitive data exposure (glucose measurements) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:A → 0.62  
- AC:L → 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) → 0.85  
- UI:N → 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H → 0.56  
- I:N → 0.0  
- A:N → 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.345  
≈ 2.84

**Impact Sub-Score = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44 × 1 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(6.4352)  
= 6.5

**CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N**

#####94#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A stack based buffer overflow exists in Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft when parsing the InitialMacroLen field of a DPS file. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file to achieve remote code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted DPS file that a user opens. The attack does not require physical or local access.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted file. This implies some user interaction but no complex conditions or environment requirements. The complexity is low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated and does not require any privileges on the target system.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker must entice a user to open the malicious file, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to remote code execution, which typically allows the attacker to execute code within the same security scope (the application or system). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Remote code execution generally allows full access to the system, including reading sensitive data. So confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Remote code execution allows the attacker to modify data or system state. Integrity impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Remote code execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., by crashing the system or deleting files). Availability impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | H     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 ≈ 0.915

**Impact:**  
= 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score:**  
= Impact + Exploitability  
= 5.88 + 2.83 = 8.71

Rounded up to one decimal place: **8.7**

#####95#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in CU Solutions Group (CUSG) Content Management System (CMS) before v.7.75 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the users.php component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a crafted script sent to a web component (users.php). This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit the vulnerability. XSS vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit if the attacker can send crafted input.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote attacker" and the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, implying the attacker starts with no privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require the victim user to interact with the malicious script (e.g., by visiting a crafted page). The attacker sends the script, but the victim must execute it.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, and obtaining sensitive information. Since it affects the CMS and escalates privileges, it likely impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component, changing the scope.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can obtain sensitive information. This indicates a high impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges, which implies a high impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N**

#####96#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"There is an illegal memory access vulnerability of ZTE's ZXCLOUD iRAI product. When the vulnerability is exploited by an attacker with the common user permission, the physical machine will be crashed."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The description does not explicitly say how the attacker exploits the vulnerability (e.g., remotely over the network, locally, or physically).  
- It mentions "an attacker with the common user permission," which implies the attacker must already have some level of access on the machine.  
- Since the attacker has "common user permission," this suggests local access, not network or physical.  
- **AV = Local (L)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of any special conditions or complexity to exploit.  
- The attacker only needs common user permission, which is not a high bar if the attacker already has local access.  
- No mention of timing or environmental conditions.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have "common user permission," which is a non-administrative user.  
- In CVSS, "None" means no privileges required, "Low" means privileges with limited access, "High" means administrative or root.  
- "Common user permission" corresponds to **Low (L)** privileges.  
- **PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that the attacker needs another user to do anything (e.g., click a link).  
- The attacker is the one exploiting the vulnerability directly.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes the physical machine to crash.  
- Does the impact affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- Since the crash affects the physical machine, it likely affects components beyond the vulnerable software process.  
- This suggests the scope is **Changed (C)**.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention any data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- **I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The physical machine will be crashed, which is a denial of service impact.  
- This is a high impact on availability.  
- **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [4.21 + 1.83, 10])  
= Roundup (6.04)  
= 6.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in Tongda OA 2017 up to 11.9
- Affected file: /general/attendance/manage/ask_duty/delete.php
- Attack vector: Manipulation of the argument ASK_DUTY_ID
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- Fix: Upgrade to version 11.10

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating a web application argument.
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- SQL Injection typically requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated.
- SQL Injection in a web parameter usually requires no privileges.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends a crafted request; no user interaction is needed.
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the same component (Tongda OA application).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.
- Since it is described as critical and SQL Injection, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact.
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**

- SQL Injection can allow data modification or deletion.
- Likely high impact on integrity.
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**

- SQL Injection can cause denial of service or data deletion.
- Likely high impact on availability.
- **A = High (H)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)
- AC:L (Low)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:N (None)
- S:U (Unchanged)
- C:H (High)
- I:H (High)
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)

= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

= round_up(min(5.87 + 3.89, 10)) = round_up(9.76) = 9.8

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Lana Shortcodes WordPress plugin before 1.2.0.
- Does not validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- Allows users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by users with contributor role or above, which means the attacker must have some level of access to the WordPress backend or at least be authenticated.  
- The attack is not remotely exploitable by unauthenticated users over the network.  
- Since the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the plugin via the web interface, the vector is **Adjacent (A)** or **Network (N)**?  
- In WordPress, contributors log in and interact via HTTP requests, which is over the network, but the attacker must be authenticated. CVSS defines "Network" as the vulnerability exploitable remotely without physical or local access. Since the attacker must be authenticated, but the attack is performed over the network, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires the attacker to have contributor role and embed malicious shortcode attributes.  
- No special conditions or timing required, just the ability to input malicious data.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor role or above.  
- Contributor is a low-level privilege in WordPress, but it is not "None".  
- According to CVSS, "Low" means some privileges are required but not administrative.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is Stored XSS, which means the malicious script is stored and executed when a user views the page/post.  
- The attacker must input the malicious shortcode attributes, but the victim must view the page for the script to execute.  
- Therefore, user interaction is **Required (R)** (the victim must view the page).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially modifying data.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: Low (L)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.05, 10)) = round_up(4.56) = 4.6 (rounded to one decimal)

- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker bypasses access restrictions, potentially exposing resources that should be protected.  
- This implies some confidentiality impact, but not necessarily full disclosure of all data.  
- Likely a **Low (L)** impact because the attacker can access resources that should be restricted but no indication of full data disclosure.  

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention modification of data or system state.  
- The attacker bypasses filters but no explicit mention of data modification.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or impact on availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

- Base Score (Scope Changed):  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (6.88 + 3.97) = Roundup (10.85) = 10.0 (max score)

#####101#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Authentication Bypass by Spoofing vulnerability in Snow Software Snow Inventory Agent on Windows allows Signature Spoof. This issue affects Snow Inventory Agent: through 6.14.5. Customers advised to upgrade to version 7.0.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Authentication Bypass by Spoofing  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to bypass authentication by spoofing a signature.  
- **Target:** Snow Inventory Agent on Windows  
- **Impact:** Likely unauthorized access or execution of privileged actions without proper authentication.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in an agent software on Windows.  
- Since it involves signature spoofing, it likely requires local access to the system or at least adjacent network access.  
- However, Snow Inventory Agent is typically a local agent installed on endpoints.  
- Spoofing a signature usually requires local access or at least adjacent network access, but not network-wide remote exploitation.  
- Given the agent runs locally and the spoofing likely requires local interaction, **AV:L (Local)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Signature spoofing usually requires some skill but not high complexity if the vulnerability is straightforward.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- So, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since it is an authentication bypass, the attacker likely does not need prior privileges.  
- However, to spoof a signature, the attacker might need to be able to interact with the agent or the system.  
- Given it's an authentication bypass, it suggests **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention the need for user interaction.  
- Authentication bypass vulnerabilities typically do not require user interaction.  
- So, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the Snow Inventory Agent on Windows.  
- If the vulnerability allows bypassing authentication within the same security scope (the agent), scope is unchanged.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or privileges beyond the agent.  
- So, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Authentication bypass can lead to unauthorized access to information.  
- The impact on confidentiality is likely **Low (L)** because it allows access to information that should be protected but not necessarily full system compromise.  
- No indication of full data disclosure.  
- So, **C:L (Low)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Authentication bypass can allow unauthorized modification of data or settings.  
- Likely **Low (L)** impact on integrity.  
- No indication of full system compromise or complete data destruction.  
- So, **I:L (Low)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **A:N (None)**.

---

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.307  
≈ 2.52

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1 of:**  
- If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
- Else, Base Score = min((Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
= 2.51 + 2.52 = 5.03 → 5.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue in symphony v.3.6.3 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the log4j component."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability via the log4j component, which is typically network accessible.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; arbitrary code execution via log4j is generally straightforward once the vulnerability is known.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can execute arbitrary code, implying no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention the need for user interaction. Exploiting log4j vulnerabilities typically does not require user interaction.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Arbitrary code execution usually allows the attacker to affect resources beyond the vulnerable component, potentially changing the scope. However, since the vulnerability is in the log4j component within the symphony application, and the attacker can execute code on the same system, the scope is likely **Unchanged (U)** because the impact is within the same security authority.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data and system files.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or deny service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
  = 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

- Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

A flaw in Shim causes a crash when an error occurs during the creation of a new ESL variable. The crash is due to a mismatch in the number of parameters in a logging function's format string.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The flaw occurs during an error in creating a new ESL variable.  
- Shim is a software component, likely running locally or on a system.  
- The description does not mention remote exploitation or network access.  
- The crash happens when an error occurs, likely triggered by local actions or processes.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is likely **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The crash happens due to a mismatch in parameters in a logging function.  
- This is a programming error that triggers a crash under certain circumstances.  
- The attacker must cause the error condition to occur.  
- Since the error condition is specific and not trivial, the complexity is likely **High (H)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not specify that privileges are needed to trigger the flaw.  
- However, since the flaw is in Shim and involves creating ESL variables, which may require some level of access.  
- Assuming the attacker must have some privileges to cause the error (e.g., to create ESL variables).  
- Without explicit info, assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The flaw occurs when Shim tries to print an error message.  
- The crash is due to a logging function error, not requiring user interaction to trigger.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The crash is local to Shim.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or changes the security scope.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The flaw causes a crash, no mention of data disclosure.  
- No confidentiality impact.  
- **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The flaw causes a crash, no mention of data modification or corruption.  
- **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The flaw causes a crash, which impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on the severity of the crash.  
- Since it is a crash, it likely causes denial of service.  
- Assuming the crash causes a denial of service, **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access needed to trigger error |
| AC     | H     | Specific error condition required |
| PR     | L     | Some privileges needed to create ESL variable |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:H = 0.44  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.31

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.31, 10))  
= round_up(4.90) = 4.9

#####104#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A buffer overflow exists in Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft version 2 when parsing the wMailContentLen field of a DPS file. An anonymous attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file to achieve code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must provide a specially crafted DPS file that the user opens. The attack requires the user to open a file, which implies local access to the file (e.g., via email attachment or file transfer). The attacker is anonymous and does not directly connect over the network to the vulnerable software.  
  Since the attacker must have the user open a file, this is **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted DPS file, but no additional conditions or environment requirements are mentioned. The attack seems straightforward once the file is opened.  
  Therefore, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is anonymous and does not require any privileges on the system before the attack.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must open the specially crafted DPS file, so user interaction is required.  
  Hence, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to code execution within the application parsing the file. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution can lead to full control, including data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows arbitrary code, so integrity is **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can disrupt availability, so availability is **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local file opening by user                                                       |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed                                                              |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Attacker is anonymous, no privileges required                                             |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must open the malicious file                                                         |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact is within the vulnerable component                                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Code execution can lead to full data disclosure                                           |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Code execution can modify data or code                                                     |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Code execution can disrupt or deny service                                                |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 1.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 × 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(7.69)  
= 7.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

**CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####105#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in AMPPS 2.7, specifically in the Encryption Passphrase Handler.
- Leads to denial of service (DoS).
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Upgrade to version 4.0 fixes the issue.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack can be launched remotely."  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Most likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and can be used.  
- Likely **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that attacker needs any privileges.  
- Since it can be launched remotely and no mention of authentication, assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- DoS via remote attack usually does not require user interaction.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects a component (Encryption Passphrase Handler) within the same software.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or security authority.  
- Assume **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The impact is denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability leads to denial of service.  
- Denial of service impacts availability.  
- Severity level is not explicitly stated, but usually DoS is at least Low or High.  
- Since the description says "problematic" and "denial of service," and no mention of complete system shutdown, assume **Low (L)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Remote attack possible                          |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions, exploit public          |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                    |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N     | No confidentiality impact                       |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact                             |
| Availability (A)     | L     | Denial of service causes availability impact   |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
≈ 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore (since Scope is Unchanged):  
Impact = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(5.3)  
= 5.3

#####106#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in openBI up to 1.0.8
- Affects function uploadFile in /application/index/controller/File.php
- Leads to unrestricted file upload (likely arbitrary file upload)
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed
- Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to initiate the attack remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description says "unrestricted upload" and no mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- Usually, unrestricted upload vulnerabilities have low complexity.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention of needing any privileges or authentication.  
- The attacker can upload files remotely without prior access.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that the attack requires user interaction (e.g., victim clicking a link).  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely, presumably without user interaction.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web application function allowing file upload.  
- Unrestricted upload can lead to remote code execution or other impacts beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Usually, unrestricted upload vulnerabilities lead to a changed scope because the impact can affect the system beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value: Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unrestricted upload itself does not directly disclose information, but if the attacker can upload malicious files, they may read or access data.  
- Since the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but the vulnerability is critical and likely leads to further compromise, we assign at least Low.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload allows attacker to upload arbitrary files, potentially modifying or replacing files.  
- This impacts integrity significantly.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Uploading arbitrary files can lead to denial of service (e.g., uploading large files, webshells causing resource exhaustion).  
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but critical rating and unrestricted upload imply at least some availability impact.  
- Assign Low (L) conservatively.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack can be initiated remotely over the network                                         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Unrestricted upload, no special conditions                                                |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required                                                                    |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                                              |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Impact extends beyond vulnerable component                                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible data exposure due to arbitrary file upload                                       |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Arbitrary file upload can modify/replace files                                            |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.44 × 0.78]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.3432]  
= 1 - 0.2677  
= 0.7323

Since Scope is Changed (S:C),  
Impact Score = 7.52 × (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.7323 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.7323 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.7033 - 3.25 × (0.7123)^15

Calculate (0.7123)^15:  
≈ 0.7123^15 ≈ 0.007 (approximate)

So,  
Impact Score ≈ 7.52 × 0.7033 - 3.25 × 0.007  
= 5.29 - 0.023  
= 5.267

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round up to one decimal place the minimum of (Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 5.267 + 3.89 = 9.157 → 9.2 (rounded up)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L

#####107#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The vulnerability is in a simple library (class.upload.php).
- It does not perform in-depth checks on uploaded files.
- This allows a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The vulnerability occurs when the default configuration is used.
- The README was updated to include guidelines to mitigate the issue.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves uploading files to the server.  
- The attacker must be able to upload files, which typically requires network access to the web application.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability occurs due to lack of in-depth checks on uploaded files in the default configuration.  
- No special conditions or timing are required; the attacker just uploads a file.  
- This suggests **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to upload files. Usually, file upload functionality is available to unauthenticated users or users with minimal privileges.  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Stored XSS requires a victim user to view the malicious content for the exploit to succeed.  
- The attacker uploads a malicious file, but the victim must interact (e.g., view the page or file) to trigger the XSS.  
- Therefore, **User Interaction Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS in the same web application.  
- It does not appear to affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via a "crafted network request," so the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; the attacker just sends a crafted request. This implies low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "unauthenticated," meaning no privileges are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that a user must interact for the attack to succeed. The attacker sends a crafted request directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows remote code execution or DoS, which typically affects the vulnerable component itself. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description mentions DoS and possible RCE, but does not explicitly mention data disclosure. RCE can lead to confidentiality impact, but since it says "possibly," we should consider at least Low impact on confidentiality.  
  To be conservative, and since RCE is possible, we assign **High (H)** for confidentiality because RCE typically allows full access to data.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  RCE implies the attacker can modify data or execute arbitrary code, so integrity is highly impacted.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  DoS attack is explicitly mentioned, which impacts availability.  
  **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | Possible RCE implies high confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | RCE implies high integrity impact |
| A      | H     | DoS implies high availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.77) = 9.8

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Tenda i6 1.0.0.9(3857), critical severity.
- Affects function `formSetCfm` in `/goform/setcfm` of `httpd` component.
- Manipulation of argument `funcpara1` leads to stack-based buffer overflow.
- Attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Vendor did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- The vulnerable component is an HTTP daemon (`httpd`), likely accessible over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.  
- No mention of special conditions or environment needed.  
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and can be used.  
- This suggests low complexity.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely, presumably without authentication.  
- No mention of needing any privileges.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is against an HTTP service, no mention of requiring user interaction.  
- Likely no user interaction required.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the HTTP daemon.  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash within the same component.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or privileges beyond the vulnerable process.  
- Usually, buffer overflow in a service leads to changed scope if it allows code execution beyond the initial component.  
- However, since it's a stack-based buffer overflow in a network service, it likely allows code execution or control over the process, which can affect system-level resources.  
- Given the critical classification and typical impact of buffer overflows, Scope = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution, which can lead to data disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but code execution usually implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Assign at least Low (L) confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow arbitrary code execution, which can modify data.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Availability impact is High (H).

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Buffer overflow likely leads to code execution beyond initial scope |
| C      | L     | Possible data disclosure due to code execution |
| I      | H     | Code execution allows full integrity compromise |
| A      | H     | Code execution or crash causes high availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculate Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.151]  
= 7.52 * 0.849  
= 6.39

**Calculate Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556  
= 8.22 * 0.472  
= 3.88

**Calculate Base Score:**

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.39 + 3.88, 10])  
= Roundup (10.27, 10)  
= 10.0

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.85

- Impact Sub-Score = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Sub-Score  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

- Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1 of minimum of (Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 5.18 + 3.85 = 9.03 → 9.0 (rounded)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Bradley B. Dalina Image Tag Manager allows Reflected XSS. This issue affects Image Tag Manager: from n/a through 1.5.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Affected software:** Image Tag Manager up to version 1.5  
- **Impact:** Allows injection of malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser.

---

### Step 2: Determine CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted URL to the victim, who must then access it. The attack is performed over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Reflected XSS usually requires the attacker to craft a specific input, but no special conditions or environment are needed beyond the victim clicking a link. This is considered low complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system; the attack is performed by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
The victim must interact by clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted URL.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
Reflected XSS affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). It does not affect other components or security domains.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser. This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.19)  
= 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####112#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in /bin/webs binary in Edimax BR6478AC V2 firmware version v1.23 allows attackers to overwrite other values located on the stack due to an incorrect use of the strcpy() function.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a binary (/bin/webs) on the device firmware.  
- The description does not explicitly say if the attacker needs local access or can exploit remotely. However, since it is a web-related binary ("webs"), it is likely accessible over the network.  
- Therefore, **AV:N (Network)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow due to strcpy misuse, which is straightforward to exploit if the attacker can send crafted input.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges to exploit.  
- Since it is a web binary, likely no privileges are required to send input.  
- Therefore, **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted input to the web binary.  
- No user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed.  
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows overwriting other values on the stack, which may affect the control flow or other processes.  
- However, the description does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Typically, buffer overflows in a local binary affect the same security scope.  
- Therefore, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Overwriting stack values can lead to code execution or information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention information disclosure, but buffer overflows often can lead to at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Given the potential for code execution, confidentiality is likely impacted at least to a Low level.  
- Therefore, **C:L (Low)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Overwriting stack values can allow an attacker to modify program behavior or data.  
- This is a direct integrity impact.  
- Therefore, **I:H (High)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflows can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- The description does not explicitly mention DoS, but it is a common impact.  
- Given the potential for crashing the service, availability impact is at least Low.  
- Therefore, **A:L (Low)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible web binary |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploit |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Potential confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to overwrite |
| A      | L     | Possible availability impact (crash) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.268)  
= 6.42 * 0.732 ≈ 4.70

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.70 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(8.61)  
= 8.6 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability in Snow Software Inventory Agent on Unix allows File Manipulation through Snow Update Packages. This issue affects Inventory Agent: through 7.3.1."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Improper verification of cryptographic signature  
- **Impact:** Allows file manipulation via update packages  
- **Affected software:** Snow Software Inventory Agent on Unix  
- **Attack vector:** Through update packages (likely remotely delivered)  
- **Effect:** File manipulation (likely affects integrity, possibly availability or confidentiality depending on the nature of the files)  

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS base metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited through update packages, which are typically delivered over a network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to improper verification of cryptographic signatures, which usually means the attacker can craft malicious update packages without complex conditions.  
- No special conditions or environment needed.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious update package. Usually, update packages are accepted by the software without requiring prior privileges on the system.  
- Since the vulnerability allows file manipulation through update packages, it suggests no privileges are required on the target system.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The update process might be automatic or manual. However, since the vulnerability involves update packages, it is likely that the user or administrator must trigger the update process or accept the update.  
- Without explicit information, assume user interaction is required to install the malicious update package.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows file manipulation within the Inventory Agent on Unix.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- File manipulation suggests integrity impact primarily.  
- No direct mention of data disclosure or confidentiality loss.  
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- File manipulation directly impacts integrity.  
- The attacker can modify files, so integrity impact is High.  
- I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- A = None (N)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in InstaWP Connect – 1-click WP Staging & Migration, affecting versions up to 0.1.0.9.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically can be exploited remotely over the network, especially if the application accepts input from remote users. Since this is a plugin for WordPress (web-based), the attack vector is likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the input is not properly sanitized. No special conditions or timing attacks are mentioned. So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
SQL Injection in a web application often requires no privileges to exploit, as it can be triggered by unauthenticated users submitting crafted input. Since the description does not mention authentication requirements, assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
Exploitation of SQL Injection typically does not require user interaction beyond the attacker sending crafted requests. So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
SQL Injection vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure. The impact is likely **High (H)** because attackers can extract sensitive data.

**Integrity (I):**  
SQL Injection can allow modification of data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
SQL Injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service (e.g., by dropping tables or locking resources). Given the severity, assume **High (H)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

### Step 3: CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####115#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability: Partial-path traversal bypass in `ZipSecurity#isBelowCurrentDirectory`.
- Impact: Allows attacker to escape intended directory path restrictions, but not to higher-level directories (e.g., cannot escape to /etc/).
- Conditions: Application must use vulnerable version (<=1.1.1) and use ZipSecurity as a guard.
- Exploit path exists.
- The bypass allows navigation into sibling paths (e.g., from `/my/app/path` to `/my/app/path-something-else`).

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a Java security toolkit used by applications.  
- Exploit requires the attacker to interact with the application using the vulnerable toolkit.  
- Since the attacker can exploit this remotely if the application exposes the vulnerable functionality over the network, or locally if the attacker has local access.  
- The description does not specify that local access is required, nor that physical access is needed.  
- Given this is a code security toolkit used in Java applications, and the exploit path exists, it is reasonable to assume the attack can be performed remotely over the network (e.g., via the application interface).  
**AV = Network (N)**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must exploit a partial-path traversal bypass.  
- The bypass is not trivial but does not require special conditions beyond using the vulnerable version and the vulnerable guard.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.  
- Therefore, the attack complexity is low.  
**AC = Low (L)**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to interact with the application using the vulnerable toolkit.  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges on the system or application.  
- The attacker can exploit this without authentication or elevated privileges.  
**PR = None (N)**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly; no mention of needing another user to perform any action.  
- No user interaction required.  
**UI = None (N)**

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows escaping into sibling paths but not into higher-level directories.  
- The control still protects from escaping the application path into higher-level directories.  
- This suggests the impact is limited to the same security scope (the application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
**S = Unchanged (U)**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can access sibling directories, which may contain sensitive data.  
- This is a partial path traversal bypass, so some unauthorized access to files is possible.  
- The impact is not total disclosure but partial.  
- Therefore, confidentiality impact is Low (L).  
**C = Low (L)**

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention the attacker can modify files or data.  
- The vulnerability is about bypassing path restrictions to read files in sibling directories.  
- No indication of integrity impact.  
**I = None (N)**

---

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of impact on availability.  
- The vulnerability does not cause denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
**A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning Summary |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same security scope |
| C      | L     | Partial unauthorized access to sibling directories |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
= approx 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= approx 1.41

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup (minimum of (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
= Roundup (1.41 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (5.3)  
= 5.3

#####116#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Use after free in Web Audio in Google Chrome prior to 121.0.6167.85 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTML page, which implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network (e.g., by convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; "Use after free" vulnerabilities in browsers are typically straightforward to exploit once discovered.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the target system before exploitation.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the victim to visit a crafted HTML page, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the Web Audio component of Chrome, which is part of the browser process. Exploiting this could lead to heap corruption and potentially code execution within the browser process. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (e.g., kernel or other system components).  
  Usually, browser use-after-free vulnerabilities are considered to have **Unchanged (U)** scope because the impact is within the same security authority.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage. However, the severity is "High," which often implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
  Given the "High" severity and typical impact of use-after-free, we assign:  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow an attacker to modify memory, leading to integrity compromise.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

| Availability (A)      | H      | Potential for denial of service due to heap corruption                                    |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(5.88 + 2.84, 10))  
= Roundup(8.72) = 8.7 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####117#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"In ged, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local denial of service with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description mentions "local denial of service" and "System execution privileges needed." This implies the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV = Local (L)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write is typically straightforward once local access is obtained.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  "System execution privileges needed" means the attacker must already have high-level privileges (system-level).  
  **PR = High (H)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to denial of service locally with system execution privileges. No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description only mentions denial of service, no data disclosure.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service is explicitly mentioned. The impact is local DoS.  
  **A = High (H)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | H     | System execution privileges needed |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High availability impact (DoS) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 for Scope Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of:  
If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
Else if Scope = Unchanged:  
Base Score = min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 3.59 + 0.79 = 4.38 → 4.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A command injection issue in TRENDnet TEW-411BRPplus v.2.07_eu that allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via the data1 parameter in the debug.cgi page.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is local (not remote network) and must access the device locally to exploit the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Command injection typically requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "local attacker" but no mention of needing any privileges. Usually, command injection via a web interface parameter implies no privileges required if the page is accessible without authentication. However, since it is a debug.cgi page, it might be restricted. The description does not specify if authentication is required.  
  Given the lack of explicit mention, assume **None (N)** privileges required.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is local and directly sends the payload via the parameter. No user interaction required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Command injection typically allows execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable component, which usually affects the same security scope (the device itself). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including reading sensitive data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows full modification of system files and data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the device.  
  **Value:** High (H)

#####119#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: i18n-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: GlobalBlocking extension in MediaWiki before 1.40.2
- Trigger: Special:GlobalBlock?uselang=x-xss URI, specifically via the parentheses message affecting subtitle links in buildSubtitleLinks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted URI (Special:GlobalBlock?uselang=x-xss).  
- This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network by sending a crafted URL.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack involves crafting a specific URI parameter to trigger XSS.  
- No indication of any special conditions or timing required.  
- This is a straightforward injection via a URL parameter.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.  
- The URI is accessible publicly (Special pages are generally accessible).  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is an XSS triggered when a user visits the crafted URL.  
- The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious link.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is an XSS in the same component (GlobalBlocking extension).  
- It does not appear to affect resources beyond the vulnerable component or escalate privileges to other components.  
- The impact is within the same security scope.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user.  
- Typically, reflected XSS leads to Low confidentiality impact (attacker can steal user cookies, session tokens, or view sensitive info).  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies a Low integrity impact.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- No indication of DoS or availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via crafted URL |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must visit malicious link |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure via XSS |
| I      | L     | Possible content/script modification |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Anton Bond Woocommerce Tranzila Payment Gateway. This issue affects Woocommerce Tranzila Payment Gateway: from n/a through 1.0.8.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data  
- **Component:** Woocommerce Tranzila Payment Gateway plugin  
- **Impact:** Typically, deserialization vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or escalate privileges depending on the context.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities in web plugins are usually exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via crafted HTTP requests).  
- So, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Deserialization of untrusted data usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted data.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a web plugin vulnerability, an attacker likely does not need any privileges to exploit it (e.g., no authentication required).  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Exploitation typically does not require user interaction; the attacker sends crafted data directly to the vulnerable component.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities often lead to code execution or impact beyond the vulnerable component, potentially affecting the entire system or application.  
- However, since this is a plugin vulnerability within Woocommerce, if the vulnerability allows code execution or data manipulation beyond the plugin's scope, Scope would be Changed (C).  
- Given typical deserialization impacts, assume Scope = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Deserialization can lead to data disclosure depending on the payload.  
- Usually, it can lead to high confidentiality impact (e.g., reading sensitive data).  
- Assign Confidentiality = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities can allow arbitrary code execution or data manipulation.  
- Integrity impact is High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Such vulnerabilities can cause denial of service or system crashes.  
- Availability impact is High (H)

- Attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely, and it involves an API endpoint.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability involves manipulation of an argument leading to unrestricted upload.  
- No special conditions or environment requirements are mentioned.  
- The exploit is publicly disclosed, suggesting it is straightforward.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

- However, the description does not explicitly mention a change in scope (e.g., affecting other components or privileges).  
- Usually, unrestricted upload can lead to scope change if it allows code execution or affects other components.  
- Since it is classified as critical and involves unrestricted upload, it is reasonable to assume scope is **Changed (C)**.  
- **Value: Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unrestricted upload primarily affects integrity and availability.  
- No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload can allow an attacker to upload malicious files, potentially modifying or adding unauthorized content.  
- This impacts integrity.  
- Since it is critical, assume **High (H)** impact on integrity.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Unrestricted upload could lead to denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but critical rating suggests possible impact.  
- Assume **High (H)** availability impact due to potential for DoS or system compromise.  
- **Value: High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Step 3.1: Calculate Impact**

Impact (Changed Scope) = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 7.52 * 0.8064  
= 6.06

**Step 3.2: Calculate Exploitability**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5563  
= 8.22 * 0.4729  
= 3.88

**Step 3.3: Calculate Base Score**

Since Scope is Changed:  
Base Score = round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= round_up (6.06 + 3.88)  
= round_up (9.94)  
= 9.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H

#####122#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.6.8. rose_ioctl in net/rose/af_rose.c has a use-after-free because of a rose_accept race condition."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Use-after-free vulnerability due to a race condition.
- **Component:** Linux kernel, specifically the rose_ioctl function in net/rose/af_rose.c.
- **Impact:** Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing privilege escalation, code execution, or denial of service.
- **Access Vector:** Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attack likely requires local access (e.g., a local user triggering the ioctl call).
- **Privileges Required:** Likely requires some level of privileges to invoke the ioctl on the device.
- **User Interaction:** Usually, kernel vulnerabilities do not require user interaction beyond the attacker triggering the ioctl call.
- **Scope:** The vulnerability is in the kernel, so if exploited, it can affect the kernel's integrity and availability, possibly changing scope.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, which can affect integrity and availability, and possibly confidentiality if kernel memory is leaked.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel and triggered via an ioctl call.  
- Typically, ioctl calls require local access.  
- So, **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a race condition, which is generally considered **High (H)** complexity because exploiting race conditions reliably is difficult.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To invoke ioctl on a device, the attacker usually needs some privileges, but not necessarily root.  
- Likely **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker triggers the ioctl directly; no other user interaction is needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel. Exploiting it can affect kernel memory and potentially escalate privileges or cause system-wide impact.  
- This means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure if memory is leaked.  
- But the description does not explicitly mention info leak, so assume **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption and code execution, so **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause crashes or denial of service, so **High (H)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local access required to invoke ioctl                                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Race condition exploitation is complex                                   |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Some privileges needed to invoke ioctl, but not root                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction needed beyond attacker triggering ioctl              |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Kernel memory corruption affects system-wide scope                       |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible info leak but not confirmed, so low impact                      |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Memory corruption can lead to code execution or modification             |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Can cause system crashes or denial of service                            |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.1279 ≈ 1.05

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.151  
= 0.849

Since Scope is Changed (C), Impact Score = 7.52 × (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.849 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.849 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.82 - 3.25 × (0.829)^15  
= 6.17 - 3.25 × 0.072 (approximate)  
= 6.17 - 0.234  
= 5.94

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else Base Score = Roundup(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(min(5.94 + 1.05, 10))  
= Roundup(6.99)  
= 7.0

#####123#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The EventON WordPress plugin before 2.2 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored HTML Injection attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin settings interface. The attack requires a user with high privileges (admin) to perform the attack. Since the attacker must be logged in and interact with the plugin settings, the attack is not remotely exploitable over the network without authentication. The attacker must be local to the application (logged in).  
  **AV = Local (L)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description suggests that the vulnerability arises from lack of sanitization and escaping in settings, which is straightforward to exploit by a high privilege user. No special conditions or race conditions are mentioned.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be a high privilege user such as admin. This means the attacker must have **High** privileges.  
  **PR = High (H)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is a high privilege user performing the attack themselves (Stored HTML Injection). No other user interaction is required.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows Stored HTML Injection, which can affect the content displayed to other users or the system's behavior. However, the description does not explicitly mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. Stored XSS or HTML Injection in WordPress plugins typically affects the same scope (the plugin or site content).  
  Since the vulnerability is within the plugin and does not escalate privileges or affect other components' security, the scope is likely **Unchanged (U)**.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stored HTML Injection can lead to information disclosure if it allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that steal cookies or data. However, the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact.  
  Usually, Stored HTML Injection can lead to **Low** confidentiality impact due to potential data leakage.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Stored HTML Injection allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML, potentially modifying displayed content or injecting scripts. This can be considered a **Low** integrity impact because the attacker can modify content but not necessarily system files or data.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

### Summary of metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Requires local access (logged in user) |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges (admin) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | L     | Potential information disclosure via injected HTML |
| I      | L     | Content modification possible |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 for Scope Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 × 0.3916  
= 2.35

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.35 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(3.14)  
= 3.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An OS command injection vulnerability has been reported to affect QcalAgent. If exploited, the vulnerability could allow authenticated users to execute commands via a network."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited via a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. OS command injection via network usually implies low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "authenticated users," so some privileges are required, but not high-level privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for exploitation. The attacker can execute commands directly once authenticated.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of commands on the affected system, which is within the same security scope (no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  OS command injection can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. The impact is likely more than none but not necessarily total compromise of confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can execute commands, which can modify or delete data, so integrity is impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Command execution can disrupt service or cause denial of service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable over network                        |

| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires authenticated user                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                    |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact within the same security scope           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Some sensitive info disclosure possible         |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Command execution can fully compromise integrity|
| Availability (A)     | H     | Command execution can disrupt availability      |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(8.27)  
= 8.3 (High severity)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and uses a crafted URL or HTTP request.  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the victim system.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack occurs inside a victim’s session, implying the victim must interact (e.g., click a link or visit a URL).  
- So user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the HTTP response headers or bodies inside the victim’s session.  
- The attacker manipulates the response within the same security scope (web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can manipulate HTTP response headers or bodies, potentially exposing or altering sensitive information in the response.  
- This suggests some confidentiality impact, but not full disclosure.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject or manipulate HTTP response headers or bodies, which means they can alter data sent to the user.  
- This is an integrity impact.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

#####126#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS through 2018-08-30. One incorrect handshake could complete with different epoch numbers in the packets Client_Hello, Client_key_exchange, and Change_cipher_spec, which may cause denial of service."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability occurs during a handshake in DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security), which is a network protocol. The attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
The issue involves an incorrect handshake completing with different epoch numbers. This suggests the attacker must send specially crafted handshake packets, but no special conditions or timing constraints are mentioned. Typically, handshake manipulation is not trivial but also not highly complex. Given no special conditions, assume low complexity.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker is initiating a handshake, which is part of the normal protocol operation. No privileges on the system are required to send handshake packets.  
**Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed; the attacker can send packets directly to the service.  
**Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
The vulnerability causes a denial of service (DoS) in the affected component (tinyDTLS). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. The scope remains unchanged.  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
No information disclosure is mentioned.  
**Value:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
No integrity impact is described.  
**Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
The vulnerability may cause denial of service, which impacts availability. The impact is likely high because the handshake failure can disrupt service.  
**Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: N (None)  
- I: N (None)  
- A: H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(7.5) = 7.5

#####127#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
"In video decoder, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a video decoder and leads to a local denial of service. Since it requires local access (e.g., opening a crafted video file), the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Out of bounds write due to missing bounds check is typically straightforward if the attacker can supply crafted input. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  "No additional execution privileges needed" implies the attacker does not need any privileges beyond what they already have. Since the attack is local, the attacker must have local access but no special privileges. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Since this is a video decoder, the user likely needs to open or play a crafted video file. This requires user interaction. So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to denial of service locally in the video decoder process. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description mentions denial of service only, no data disclosure. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption beyond denial of service. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service is explicitly mentioned. The impact is on availability. Since it is a "local denial of service," and the severity is not specified as partial or complete, we assume **Low (L)** impact (typical for local DoS).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to exploit |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must open/play crafted video |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Denial of service impact on availability |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
≈ 8.22 * 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.24)  
= 3.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification of data or code.  
- The vulnerability causes crash or read, but no integrity impact described.  
- **I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker can crash the service causing a DoS.  
- This is a clear availability impact.  
- The impact is service crash, which is significant but not total destruction.  
- Usually, DoS caused by crash is considered Low or High depending on severity.  
- Since the service crashes, availability is impacted significantly.  
- Let's assign **A = High (H)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

#####130#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's TLS implementation.
- A use-after-free occurs due to improper reference counting on pages during partial reads and async decrypt.
- The issue happens in kernel code, specifically in `tls_decrypt_sg` and `tls_decrypt_done`.
- This leads to a use-after-free when reading from a partially-read socket buffer (skb).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's TLS code, which handles network traffic.  
- The attack likely occurs via network packets processed by the kernel's TLS stack.  
- Therefore, the attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue involves a use-after-free triggered by partial reads and async decrypt operations.  
- This suggests some conditions must be met (partial reads, async decrypt), but no special environment or timing constraints are mentioned.  
- Use-after-free bugs in kernel code are often exploitable with low complexity if the attacker can send crafted network traffic.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel's network stack TLS code.  
- The attacker can send network traffic to trigger the bug.  
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have privileges on the system.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by network traffic processed by the kernel.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel code, and the impact is on kernel memory (use-after-free).  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel's internal memory management, which is part of the same security authority.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the kernel's security scope.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure if the freed memory contains sensitive data.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data leakage, but use-after-free often allows reading stale memory.  
- Assume at least some information disclosure is possible.  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can allow an attacker to modify memory or cause corruption.  
- The description implies a memory corruption bug, which can affect integrity.  
- Assume low impact on integrity (e.g., partial corruption or modification).  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- The description implies a crash or instability due to use-after-free.  
- Assume low impact on availability (e.g., kernel crash or reboot).  
- **A = Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions or environment needed |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within kernel scope |
| C      | L     | Possible information disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Possible denial of service |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 1 - 0.474 ≈ 0.526

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(3.38 + 3.87) = round_up(7.25) = 7.3 → 7.3 rounds to 7.3 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

#####131#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via admin settings.
- Affected plugin: WordPress Button Plugin MaxButtons (up to 9.7.4).
- Attack vector: Injection of arbitrary scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.
- Attacker: Authenticated users with administrator-level permissions or above.
- Additional notes: 
  - Only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html is disabled.
  - Administrators can delegate button creation privileges to lower-privileged users (contributor+), allowing them to carry out attacks.
- Impact: Execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of users who view the injected page.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface (admin settings).
- The attacker must be authenticated and inject scripts that execute when other users access the page.
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.
- The attack is performed over the network (HTTP requests).

**Value:** Network (N)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability requires the attacker to have administrator-level permissions or delegated button creation privileges.
- The attacker must inject scripts via admin settings.
- No special conditions or timing required beyond having the privileges.
- The attack is straightforward once privileges are obtained.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level permissions or have delegated button creation privileges (contributor+).
- Contributor+ is a lower privilege than admin but still requires authentication.
- Since the attacker must be authenticated with at least contributor-level privileges (which is not None), PR is Low.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires a user to access the injected page for the script to execute.
- The attacker injects the script, but the victim must view the page.
- This means user interaction is required (the victim must visit the page).

**Value:** Required (R)

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the WordPress plugin and the impact is on the same security scope (the WordPress application).
- The vulnerability allows script execution in the context of the application, but does not escalate privileges beyond the application boundary.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope.

**Value:** Unchanged (U)

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- This can lead to partial or full disclosure of confidential information.
- Usually, XSS is rated as Low (L) for confidentiality because it can disclose some information but not full system data.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of users.
- This is a modification of data or behavior, so integrity is impacted.
- Usually rated as Low (L) because the attacker can modify content but not fully control the system.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Availability (A):**

- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.
- No indication that the attack causes denial of service or resource exhaustion.

**Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: Network (N)
- AC: Low (L)

- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Round_up (4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1 contains a stack overflow via the adv.iptv.stballvlans parameter in the function getIptvInfo.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered via a parameter (adv.iptv.stballvlans). This suggests it is exploitable remotely, likely over the network (e.g., via a web interface or network service).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Stack overflow vulnerabilities triggered by a parameter usually do not require special conditions beyond sending a crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the parameter is accessible remotely and no mention of needing authentication, assume no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that user interaction is required for exploitation. Usually, stack overflow via a network parameter does not require user interaction.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is a stack overflow in a function of the device firmware. Usually, this affects the same security scope (the vulnerable component and impacted component are the same). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stack overflow can lead to code execution or crash. No explicit mention of data disclosure, but code execution can lead to confidentiality impact. However, since only stack overflow is mentioned, assume at least some confidentiality impact (e.g., attacker can read some data).  
  Given typical stack overflow impact, assume **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Stack overflow can allow attacker to modify memory or execute arbitrary code, which impacts integrity.  
  Assume **Low (L)** or **High (H)**. Since no explicit code execution is mentioned, but stack overflow often leads to code execution, assume **High (H)** integrity impact.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Stack overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  Assume **Low (L)** or **High (H)**. Since stack overflow often causes crashes, assume **High (H)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(9.33) = 9.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Origin validation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One security agent.  
- Impact: Allows a local attacker to escalate privileges.  
- Exploitation prerequisite: Attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.  
- Attack vector: Local (since attacker must execute code on the system).  
- Privileges required: Low (attacker must have low-privileged code execution).  
- User interaction: Not mentioned, so assume none required.  
- Scope: Privilege escalation typically changes scope (from user to higher privileges).  
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability: Privilege escalation mainly affects integrity (ability to modify system), possibly availability and confidentiality depending on context, but the description only explicitly mentions privilege escalation, so integrity is High, confidentiality and availability likely None or Low. Since no data disclosure or DoS mentioned, assume Confidentiality: None, Availability: None.

---

### Metric Values:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must execute code locally.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: No special conditions or complexity mentioned beyond having low-privileged code execution.

  Reason: Attacker must have low-privileged code execution.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  Reason: No user interaction mentioned.

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation changes scope from low privilege to higher privilege.

- **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)  
  Reason: No mention of data disclosure.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation allows attacker to modify system or elevate privileges.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  Reason: No mention of availability impact.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N

#####134#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue discovered in TOTOLINK X6000R v9.4.0cu.852_B20230719 allows attackers to run arbitrary commands via the sub_41284C function."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description does not specify that the attacker needs physical access or adjacency. Since the vulnerability allows running arbitrary commands, it is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity. Running arbitrary commands usually implies low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "allows attackers to run arbitrary commands," implying no prior privileges are needed.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that user interaction is required. Usually, command execution vulnerabilities do not require user interaction unless specified.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary commands, which likely affects the system beyond the vulnerable component. This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **S = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can lead to full data disclosure. So, confidentiality impact is high.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary command execution allows full modification of data.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can disrupt or disable services.  
  **A = High (H)**

|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses privilege boundaries |

| I      | H     | Full integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Full availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

- Impact Sub-Score (Scope Changed):  
  ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact = 7.52 * (ISC - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * 0.142  
  = 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

- Base Score = Roundup(Min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = Roundup(Min(1.08 * (6.20 + 3.91), 10))  
  = Roundup(Min(1.08 * 10.11, 10))  
  = Roundup(Min(10.92, 10))  
  = 10.0

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####135#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via featured image alt text.
- Affected software: Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin for WordPress, versions ≤ 4.5.3.
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
- Attackers: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above.
- Impact: Inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via the web interface.  
- The attacker must have contributor-level access, so the attack is not from the network directly but through the web application interface.  
- However, since the attacker can exploit this remotely via the web interface (HTTP request), the vector is considered **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher.  
- Contributor is a low-level privilege but not none.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, contributor-level access corresponds to **Low (L)** privileges.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker injects the script, but the script executes when another user accesses the injected page.  
- The victim user must view the page for the script to execute.  
- This means user interaction is **Required (R)** (the victim must access the page).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin and its users).  
- The impact is on the same system, no privilege escalation beyond the scope.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality (some data can be exposed).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network (web interface) |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | L     | Requires contributor-level privileges |
| UI     | R     | Victim must view the injected page |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact (data exposure) |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact (script injection) |
| A      | N     | No impact on availability |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.05) = Roundup(4.56) = 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(7.5) = 7.5

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **7.5** (High severity).

#####138#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability: stack-based buffer overflow in the function fromSetSysTime of /goform/SetSysTimeCfg.
- Attack vector: The attack may be launched remotely.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Impact: Buffer overflow typically allows code execution or crash, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Privileges: Not explicitly stated, but since the attack is remote and involves manipulating an argument, likely no privileges required.
- User interaction: Not mentioned, likely none.
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but buffer overflow in a local function likely affects the same security scope (the device itself).
- Impact on C, I, A: Buffer overflow usually leads to high impact on integrity and availability, and possibly confidentiality.

---

### Metric Determination:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - "The attack may be launched remotely."  
   - This implies Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - No special conditions or environment required are mentioned.  
   - The exploit is public and straightforward (buffer overflow via argument manipulation).  
   - So, Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - No mention of needing any privileges.  
   - The attacker can send the payload remotely.  
   - So, None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - No mention of user interaction required.  
   - The attacker can launch the attack directly.  
   - So, None (N).

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability is in a function of the device itself.  
   - No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
   - So, Unchanged (U).

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or information disclosure.  
   - Since the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but buffer overflow can lead to high impact, we consider High (H) for confidentiality.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - Buffer overflow can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of data.  
   - So, High (H).

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
   - So, High (H).

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack can be launched remotely over the network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |

#####139#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An authentication bypass vulnerability in GL.iNet devices via NGINX Lua string pattern matching.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The issue is an authentication bypass in NGINX on network devices.  
- Since NGINX is a network-facing service, the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is an authentication bypass via Lua string pattern matching.  
- No indication that special conditions or timing are required.  
- Usually, authentication bypasses via pattern matching are straightforward once the flaw is known.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Authentication bypass means the attacker does not need any privileges to exploit.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly to bypass authentication.  
- No user interaction is required.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the authentication mechanism of the device's NGINX service.  
- The impact is on the same security authority (the device itself).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Authentication bypass can allow unauthorized access to the device.  
- This likely leads to unauthorized disclosure of information.  
- The impact is probably more than minimal but not necessarily full system compromise.  
- Given the bypass, attacker can access information they shouldn't.  
- **C = High (H)** (since authentication bypass usually leads to full access to confidential info)

**Integrity (I):**  
- With authentication bypass, attacker can likely modify settings or data.  
- This implies a high impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- The vulnerability is about authentication bypass, not availability.  
- **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize Metric Values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(5.18 + 3.88, 10))  
= Roundup(9.06) = 9.1

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N**

#####140#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
In OpenHarmony v4.0.0 and prior versions, a local attacker can cause a heap overflow through an integer overflow.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is **local** (not remote/network), so AV = **L** (Local).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; integer overflow leading to heap overflow is typically straightforward once local access is obtained. So AC = **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as a "local attacker," which implies the attacker must have some level of access to the system. Since it is local, but no mention of needing elevated privileges, assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of needing user interaction; the attacker is local and can trigger the overflow directly. So UI = **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  Heap overflow can lead to memory corruption that affects other components or privileges beyond the vulnerable component. Usually, heap overflow can lead to privilege escalation or affect other components, so Scope = **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap overflow can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact. However, heap overflow often can lead to at least some information disclosure. Assign **Low (L)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap overflow can allow modification of memory, so integrity is impacted. Assign **High (H)** because heap overflow can allow arbitrary code execution or modification.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap overflow can cause crashes or denial of service. Assign **Low (L)** as it can cause some availability impact.

| Scope (S)            | C     | Heap overflow can affect beyond vulnerable component |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible information disclosure                 |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Memory corruption can lead to high integrity impact |
| Availability (A)     | L     | Possible denial of service                       |

#####141#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Reflected XSS via Image URL Import Feature.
- A rogue administrator (i.e., someone with admin privileges) can inject malicious code.
- The malicious code executes on the website user's browser.
- The vulnerability requires administrator privileges.
- The attack involves importing images (likely via a web interface).
- The impact is on the website users (not the administrator).
- The scope is unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security authority).
- The Concrete CMS Security team scored this as 2 with vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.

---

### Step 1: Determine each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network (importing images via web interface).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)  
  The official score uses AC:H, indicating some complexity (e.g., requires specific conditions or knowledge).

- **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H)  
  The attacker must be a rogue administrator, which is a high privilege level.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The malicious code executes on the website user's browser, so user interaction is required (the user must visit the page).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the CMS system).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  The malicious code can steal some information from the user’s browser, so confidentiality is impacted at a low level.

- **Integrity (I):** None (N)  
  The vulnerability does not modify data on the server or CMS.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No impact on availability.

---

### Step 2: Summarize each metric's value

- AV: N (Network)
- AC: H (High)
- PR: H (High)
- UI: R (Required)
- S: U (Unchanged)
- C: L (Low)
- I: N (None)
- A: N (None)

### Step 3: Final CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N**

#####142#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The WP-Invoice WordPress plugin through 4.3.1 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, and is lacking sanitisation as well as escaping in some of them, allowing attacker to make a logged in admin change them and add XSS payload in them.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- The vulnerability allows an attacker to change plugin settings and inject XSS payloads.
- The attacker must be **logged in as an admin** (high privileges).
- The attack exploits lack of CSRF protection, meaning the attack can be triggered via a crafted request from the network.
- The attacker can inject XSS payloads, which impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some extent.
- The attack vector is likely **Network** because the attacker can send crafted requests remotely.
- User interaction is **Required** because the admin must be logged in and perform some action (or the admin's browser must be tricked into sending the request).
- Scope is **Unchanged** because the vulnerability affects the plugin itself, not other components or privileges beyond the plugin.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  No special conditions or environment needed beyond being logged in as admin.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H)  
  The attacker must be logged in as an admin, which is a high privilege level.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The attack requires the admin to be logged in and either perform an action or have their browser tricked into sending a request (CSRF).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The impact is limited to the plugin itself, no privilege escalation beyond the plugin.

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  XSS can lead to some data disclosure but not full system compromise.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  Settings can be changed, so integrity is impacted but not completely destroyed.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No indication that availability is affected.

#####143#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
FusionPBX prior to 5.1.0 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. If this vulnerability is exploited by a remote authenticated attacker with an administrative privilege, an arbitrary script may be executed on the web browser of the user who is logging in to the product.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and exploits the vulnerability over the network (web application).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; XSS vulnerabilities are generally low complexity to exploit once authenticated.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated with administrative privileges. Administrative privileges are considered **High** privileges.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim user to log in to the product and have their browser execute the script. This means user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary script in the context of the victim user's browser, which is a different security authority than the attacker’s privileges. This is a classic case of scope change (from the attacked component to the victim user’s browser).  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim user. This is typically considered Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can execute arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying data or actions performed by the victim user. This is Low impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | H     | Requires administrative privileges |
| UI     | R     | Requires victim user interaction (login) |
| S      | C     | Scope changes to victim user’s browser |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 when Scope is Changed)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.1674  
≈ 8.22 × 0.1097  
≈ 0.901

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 7.52 × 0.3916  
= 2.946

Since Scope is Changed:

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
Impact' = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
Impact' = 2.946 (as above)

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact' + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.946 + 0.901)  
= Roundup (3.847)  
= 3.9

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N**

#####144#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Autolab (course management service)
- Vulnerability: Path traversal in assessment functionality
- Impact: Instructors can perform arbitrary file reads
- Versions affected: Prior to 2.12.0
- No feasible workarounds
- Attack vector: Over the Web (network accessible)
- Privileges: Instructors (implies some level of privilege)
- No mention of user interaction required
- Impact: Arbitrary file reads (confidentiality impact), no mention of integrity or availability impact

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the Web.  
- This implies Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- Path traversal is usually straightforward if the vulnerability exists.  
- So, Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "instructors can perform arbitrary file reads."  
- Instructors are users with some privileges (not unauthenticated).  
- So, Privileges Required: Low (L) (since instructors have some privileges, but not high-level admin).  
- If it were no privileges, it would say anyone can exploit it. Here, only instructors can exploit it.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker (instructor) can exploit directly.  
- So, None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary files on the system.  
- Does this affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- Since it's a path traversal allowing arbitrary file reads, it likely affects the system beyond the vulnerable component.  
- However, CVSS guidance says if the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component, Scope is Changed (C).  
- Here, the vulnerable component is Autolab's assessment functionality; reading arbitrary files outside this component changes scope.  
- So, Scope: Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary file reads allow disclosure of sensitive information.  
- This is a High (H) impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification of files or data.  
- So, None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, None (N).

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
  ≈ 2.25 (approx)

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 × 1 × 1)  
  = 1 - 0.44  
  = 0.56

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.56 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.56 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.531 - 3.25 × (0.54)^15  
  = 3.99 - 3.25 × very small number  
  ≈ 3.99 (since (0.54)^15 is very small)

- Base Score (Scope Changed) =  
  If Impact ≤ 0, then 0  
  Else min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
  = min(1.08 × (3.99 + 2.25), 10)  
  = min(1.08 × 6.24, 10)

  = 6.74

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Anomali Match before 4.6.2
- Vulnerability: OS Command Injection
- Conditions: Requires an authenticated admin user
- Impact: Execute OS commands, elevate privileges, potentially full system compromise
- Attack vector: Not explicitly stated, but since it requires an authenticated admin user, likely network access with credentials
- User interaction: Not explicitly stated, but since the attacker is an authenticated admin user, no additional user interaction is likely needed beyond authentication

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated admin user, so the attack is not physical or local in the sense of direct system access.  
- Since the attacker is an admin user, presumably accessing the system remotely (e.g., via web interface or network service).  
- Therefore, **Network (N)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated admin user, which is a significant precondition.  
- However, once authenticated, the injection is straightforward (improper input handling).  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond authentication.  
- AC is usually Low if no special conditions beyond authentication are needed.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated admin user.  
- Admin user implies **High (H)** privileges.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the admin user executing commands; no other user needs to interact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of OS commands and potentially compromises the underlying OS.  
- This means the impact crosses from the vulnerable component (Anomali Match application) to the underlying OS.  
- This is a **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can execute OS commands, which can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute commands, modify system files, etc.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker can execute commands that could disrupt system availability.  
- So, **High (H)**.

| Scope (S)            | C     | Impact crosses from application to OS                                                    |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Full system compromise possible                                                          |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Full system compromise possible                                                          |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Full system compromise possible                                                          |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 if Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.2295  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.1767  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.1502  
  ≈ 1.234

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
  = 1 - 0.085184  
  = 0.914816

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.914816 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.914816 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.885816 - 3.25 × (0.894816)^15

Calculate (0.894816)^15:  
Approximately 0.894816^15 ≈ 0.166 (using logarithms or approximation)

So:  
Impact ≈ 7.52 × 0.885816 - 3.25 × 0.166  
= 6.661 - 0.5395  
= 6.1215

- Base Score (Scope Changed):  
  If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
  Else Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))

Calculate:  
Impact + Exploitability = 6.1215 + 1.234 = 7.3555  
1.08 × 7.3555 = 7.944  
Base Score = 7.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Directory Traversal Vulnerability in LiveConfig before v.2.5.2 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted request to the /static/ endpoint.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and sends a crafted request to a web endpoint. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Directory traversal via a crafted request is usually straightforward.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can send a crafted request without any mention of needing credentials or privileges.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted request directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information but does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. Directory traversal typically affects the same scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can obtain sensitive information, which means confidentiality is impacted. The impact is likely significant but not total system compromise.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No indication that the attacker can modify data.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| AV     | N      |
| AC     | L      |
| PR     | N      |
| UI     | N      |
| S      | U      |
| C      | H      |
| I      | N      |
| A      | N      |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44) = 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.91, 10)) = round_up(7.5052) = 7.5 → 8.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The XML parser in Magic xpi Integration Platform 4.13.4 allows XXE attacks, e.g., via onItemImport."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** XXE (XML External Entity) attack  
- **Component:** XML parser in Magic xpi Integration Platform 4.13.4  
- **Attack vector:** Likely remote, since XML parsers typically process input from external sources. The example "via onItemImport" suggests an interface or API that accepts XML input.  
- **Impact:** XXE can lead to disclosure of confidential data, server-side request forgery, or denial of service. The description is brief, but typically XXE leads to confidentiality and possibly integrity or availability impacts.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since the attack is via XML input, likely over a network interface (e.g., API or service).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- XXE attacks usually require the attacker to send a specially crafted XML payload, but no special conditions or timing are needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Usually, XXE attacks do not require authentication or privileges; the attacker just needs to send malicious XML input.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends the malicious XML directly; no user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- XXE can lead to disclosure of files or network resources outside the application, but the vulnerability is in the XML parser component of the same system.  
- Usually, XXE is considered **Scope: Unchanged (U)** because the impact is within the same security authority.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XXE can disclose sensitive files or data.  
- Usually, confidentiality impact is **High (H)** if arbitrary files can be read.  
- Since the description is brief, but XXE is known for data disclosure, assign **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- XXE typically does not allow modification of data, only reading or denial of service.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- XXE can cause denial of service by resource exhaustion or crashes.  
- The description does not specify DoS, but it's a common impact.  
- To be conservative, assign **Low (L)** availability impact.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible XML parser |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | H     | Disclosure of sensitive data via XXE |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Possible DoS impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(8.10) = 8.1 → 8.1 rounds to 8.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, which usually means low complexity.  
- No special conditions or timing required.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.5952 + 3.88)  
= Round_up (7.4752)  
= 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An file upload vulnerability in Ivanti ITSM before 2023.4, allows an authenticated remote user to perform file writes to the server. Successful exploitation may lead to execution of commands in the context of non-root user."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is a remote user (not local or physical).  
- The vulnerability is exploited over the network (file upload).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated but no mention of additional complex conditions.  
- File upload vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if authentication is present.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated (remote user).  
- The description says "authenticated remote user," but no indication that high privileges are required.  
- The attacker can execute commands as a non-root user, so likely low privileges are sufficient.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of requiring another user to interact.  
- The attacker is authenticated and can upload files directly.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**

- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes privileges beyond the scope.  
- The scope remains unchanged.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can execute commands, which implies potential access to sensitive data.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
- Execution of commands as non-root user may allow some data access, but likely limited.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can write files and execute commands, which impacts integrity.  
- This is a clear integrity impact.  
- Assign **High (H)** for integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- No explicit mention of availability impact.  
- Execution of commands could potentially affect availability, but not explicitly stated.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Unchanged)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(4.22 + 2.68) = round_up(6.9) = 6.9

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **6.9** (Medium severity).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Epiphyt Embed Privacy allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Embed Privacy: from n/a through 1.8.0.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely via the network (e.g., through a web interface).  
- **Privileges Required:** Typically none, as the attacker just needs to send crafted input to the web application.  
- **User Interaction:** Usually required, as the victim must visit the malicious page or trigger the stored XSS payload.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: Potentially high, as attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.  
  - Integrity: Potentially high, as attacker can modify displayed content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
  - Availability: Usually none or low, as XSS typically does not affect availability.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., visit a page) to trigger the XSS payload.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects resources within the same security scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  Attacker can steal sensitive information.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  Attacker can modify content or perform actions as the user.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No impact on availability.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable remotely over network               |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                   |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                             |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[5.18 + 2.84, 10])  
= Roundup(8.02) = 8.0

#####151#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
gpac v2.2.1 was discovered to contain a memory leak via the dst_props variable in the gf_filter_pid_merge_properties_internal function.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Memory leak  
- **Impact:** Memory leak typically affects availability (resource exhaustion), possibly leading to denial of service. It usually does not affect confidentiality or integrity directly.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since the function is internal (gf_filter_pid_merge_properties_internal), it suggests local code execution or local access rather than remote network access.  
- **Privileges Required:** Not explicitly stated, but since it is a function internal to the software, it likely requires some level of privileges or local access.  
- **User Interaction:** Not mentioned, likely none.  
- **Scope:** Not mentioned, likely unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security scope).  

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in an internal function, no indication it can be exploited remotely over a network. Most likely **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No special conditions or complexity mentioned. Memory leak exploitation is usually straightforward once local access is obtained. So **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the function is internal, it likely requires some privileges to trigger. No indication that no privileges are needed. Assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. Assume **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. Assume **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Memory leak does not expose confidential information. **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No indication of data modification. **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Memory leak can degrade availability by exhausting resources. Usually considered **Low (L)** impact unless it causes a crash or full denial of service. Since only a leak is mentioned, **Low (L)**.

|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local function, no network access               |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions                            |

| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                        |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                              |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Memory leak causes low availability impact      |

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Unchanged)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:L (0.22)  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.87

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(1.41 + 1.87) = round_up(3.28) = 3.3

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Tenda AC15 firmware (version 15.03.05.18).
- Affected function: fromSysToolReboot in /goform/SysToolReboot.
- Attack vector: Remote.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Vendor: No response.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- CSRF attacks typically require the attacker to trick a user into submitting a request from their browser.  
- The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- The attack is over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
**Value:** Network (N)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious page or click a link.  
- This is a common and straightforward attack technique, no special conditions or environment needed.  
- Therefore, the complexity is low.  
**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the device itself.  
- However, CSRF requires the victim user to be authenticated (logged in) to the device's web interface.  
- The attacker exploits the victim's privileges, not their own.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, if the attacker needs the victim to be authenticated, but the attacker themselves does not need privileges, PR is None (N).  
- But since the attacker relies on the victim's privileges, PR is None.  
**Value:** None (N)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- CSRF requires the victim to perform some action, such as visiting a malicious website or clicking a link.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
**Value:** Required (R)

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the device's web interface).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, scope is Unchanged (U).  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- CSRF in this case leads to a reboot function being triggered.  
- No indication that confidentiality of data is affected.  
- No data disclosure mentioned.  
**Value:** None (N)

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can cause the device to reboot by sending a forged request.  
- This is a modification of the device's state (rebooting).  
- This impacts integrity (modification of system state).  
- The impact is significant but not total compromise of integrity.  
- Rebooting is a disruption but not necessarily full integrity loss.  
- According to CVSS, rebooting a device is typically considered a Low or High impact on integrity depending on context.  
- Since rebooting interrupts normal operation and modifies system state, but does not allow arbitrary code execution or data modification, **Low (L)** is appropriate.  
**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Availability (A):**  
- Rebooting the device causes temporary unavailability.  
- This is a clear impact on availability.  
- The reboot causes a denial of service for a short period.  
- This is typically considered Low (L) impact on availability.  
**Value:** Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning Summary                                      |
|----------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote network attack                                  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward CSRF attack                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required by attacker                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact (visit malicious page)           |

| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                              |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Reboot modifies system state (low integrity impact)  |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Reboot causes temporary denial of service             |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else: Roundup(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(min(2.51 + 2.84, 10))  
= Roundup(5.35) = 5.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WP Zone Inline Image Upload for BBPress. This issue affects Inline Image Upload for BBPress: from n/a through 1.1.18.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and impact

- **Vulnerability type:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)  
- **Affected component:** WP Zone Inline Image Upload for BBPress plugin  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions.

---

### Step 2: Determine CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network (via the victim's browser).  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious site or click a crafted link.  
- This is a common and straightforward attack, so complexity is low.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be authenticated (have privileges).  
- For CVSS, PR is from the attacker's perspective. The attacker does not need privileges on the target system.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must interact by visiting a malicious site or clicking a link.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- CSRF usually does not expose confidential information directly.  
- Impact on confidentiality is None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- CSRF can cause unauthorized actions, modifying data or state.  
- This implies a Low or High impact on integrity depending on the action.  
- Since it allows unauthorized actions but not necessarily full control, we assign Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- CSRF generally does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N)

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: N (None)  
- I: L (Low)  
- A: N (None)

#####157#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- The vulnerability is in Arm's cache cleaning/invalidation helpers.
- The arithmetic can overflow, causing the cache cleaning/invalidation to be skipped.
- This results in no guarantee that all writes reach memory.
- This could lead to stale or inconsistent data being used by a guest (in virtualization context).
- The description does not specify how the vulnerability is triggered or exploited, but it involves low-level cache operations.
- The impact is on data integrity and possibly availability (if stale data causes issues).
- No explicit mention of user interaction or privilege requirements.
- The vulnerability is in a helper function used during guest memory allocation, so likely exploitable by software running on the host or guest.

---

### Step 1: Determine Attack Vector (AV)

- The vulnerability is in cache helpers used during guest memory allocation.
- This is a low-level operation, likely triggered by software running locally on the system (e.g., hypervisor or guest OS).
- Not remotely exploitable over a network.
- Not physical.
- Adjacent network is unlikely because this is about memory management.
- Most likely **Local (L)**.

**AV = L**

---

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)

- The issue is an arithmetic overflow in helper functions.
- This is a programming error, likely easy to trigger if the input is controlled.
- No mention of special conditions or timing.
- So, **Low (L)** complexity.

**AC = L**

---

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)

- The helpers are used during guest memory allocation.
- To trigger this, an attacker likely needs to allocate or manipulate guest memory.
- This suggests some level of privilege, e.g., guest user or hypervisor user.
- Since it affects guest memory, a guest user might be able to trigger it.
- Guest user privileges are usually considered **Low (L)** privileges.
- If it required root or hypervisor privileges, it would be High.
- So, **Low (L)** privileges required.

**PR = L**

---

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)

- The vulnerability is in a helper function used internally.
- No mention of requiring another user to interact.
- The attacker can trigger it themselves.
- So, **None (N)**.

**UI = N**

---

### Step 5: Scope (S)

- The vulnerability causes cache cleaning to be skipped.
- This affects memory consistency.
- The impact is on the guest memory, which is a different security authority than the host.
- This suggests the vulnerability crosses security boundaries (host to guest).
- Therefore, **Scope Changed (C)**.

**S = C**

---

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)

- The issue causes writes to not reach memory.
- This could lead to stale data being read.
- Could an attacker read sensitive data they shouldn't?
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.
- The impact is more about data integrity and availability.
- So, **Confidentiality: Low (L)** (some potential for data inconsistency, but no direct disclosure).

**C = L**

---

### Step 7: Integrity (I)

- Skipping cache cleaning means data may be stale or incorrect.
- This directly impacts data integrity.
- The impact is significant but not total control.
- So, **Integrity: High (H)** (since writes may not reach memory, causing incorrect data).

**I = H**

---

### Step 8: Availability (A)

- If writes do not reach memory, this could cause system instability or crashes.
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact.
- However, stale or inconsistent data could cause denial of service.
- So, **Availability: Low (L)**.

**A = L**

---

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access needed to trigger |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trigger overflow |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges (guest user) required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security boundaries (host to guest) |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact possible |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to skipped writes |
| A      | L     | Low availability impact possible |

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with these values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Step 1: Calculate Impact**

Impact Subscore (ISC) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]

= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]

= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]

= 1 - [0.268]

= 0.732

Since Scope is Changed:

Impact = 7.52 * (ISC - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC - 0.02)^15

= 7.52 * (0.732 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.732 - 0.02)^15

= 7.52 * 0.703 - 3.25 * (0.712)^15

= 5.29 - 3.25 * (very small number)

The second term is negligible.

Impact ≈ 5.29

---

**Step 2: Calculate Exploitability**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI

= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.223

= 1.83

---

**Step 3: Calculate Base Score**

Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

= Roundup (5.29 + 1.83) = Roundup (7.12) = 7.1

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in EFS Easy File Sharing FTP 2.0.
- The issue is triggered by manipulation of the "username" argument.
- Leads to Denial of Service (DoS).
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- No vendor response.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- Since it's an FTP service, the attacker can connect over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No special conditions or environment needed are mentioned.  
- The attack involves manipulating a username argument, which is straightforward.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to send a username argument to cause DoS.  
- No mention of needing any privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can launch the attack directly; no user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes denial of service in the same component (FTP service).  
- No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability leads to denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- Denial of service impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely significant enough to cause service disruption.  
- Since the description says "denial of service" but does not specify partial or complete, we assume **High (H)** impact on availability.  
- **Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summarize Metric Values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6 × 0.56  
= 3.36

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (3.36 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (7.25)  
= 7.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Integer overflow vulnerability in FFmpeg before n6.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the jpegxl_anim_read_packet component in the JPEG XL Animation decoder.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers. FFmpeg is a multimedia framework that processes media files or streams, so the attack can be launched over a network (e.g., by processing a crafted media file or stream).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; integer overflow vulnerabilities in decoding components are typically straightforward to exploit if the attacker can supply crafted input.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can trigger the vulnerability by supplying crafted input (e.g., a malicious media file). No privileges are required to exploit.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker must supply a crafted media file or stream that the victim processes. This usually requires the user to open or process the malicious file. So user interaction is required (e.g., opening a malicious file).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code within FFmpeg. FFmpeg is a single software component, so the impact is within the same security scope (no privilege escalation beyond the component).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is High (H).

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High (H).

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can cause system crashes or denial of service, so availability impact is High (H).

#####160#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Missing Authorization vulnerability in SedLex Image Zoom. This issue affects Image Zoom: from n/a through 1.8.8."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Missing Authorization  
- **Component:** SedLex Image Zoom plugin  
- **Effect:** Because of missing authorization, unauthorized users can likely perform actions they should not be able to.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Missing authorization usually means the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, often over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Since this is a web plugin, the attack vector is likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Missing authorization is typically straightforward to exploit, no special conditions required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since authorization is missing, the attacker likely does not need any privileges.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Usually, missing authorization vulnerabilities do not require user interaction; the attacker can send requests directly.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component?  
- Missing authorization in a plugin usually affects the same scope (the plugin or application).  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Missing authorization can allow unauthorized access to data, so confidentiality impact is at least **Low (L)**.  
- Without more details, assume **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Missing authorization may allow unauthorized modification of data or settings.  
- Assume **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Usually missing authorization does not directly affect availability.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(3.87 + 2.51) = round_up(6.38) = 6.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) version 1.0
- Cause: Insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs in multiple parameters
- Attack vector: Remote attacker sends a specially crafted URL
- Impact: Steal session cookie credentials of an authenticated user

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a URL that exploits insufficient encoding.  
- No mention of any special conditions or timing required.  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if no additional conditions are needed.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends a URL to an authenticated user, so the victim must be authenticated.  
- The attacker themselves does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must be logged in.  
- According to CVSS guidance, PR is about the attacker’s privileges, not the victim’s.  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must send a URL to an authenticated user, who must click or visit the URL.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stealing session cookies, which affects the user’s session but does not indicate a change in scope (no impact on other components beyond the vulnerable component).  
- The impact is within the same security scope.  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session cookie credentials, which is a confidentiality breach.  
- This is a significant leak of sensitive information.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1:**  
= Roundup (Impact + Exploitability) = Roundup (3.60 + 2.84) = Roundup (6.44) = 6.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Tenda i6 1.0.0.9(3857)
- Function affected: formWifiMacFilterGet in /goform/WifiMacFilterGet (httpd component)
- Vulnerability type: stack-based buffer overflow via manipulation of the argument "index"
- Attack can be launched remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Vendor did not respond

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- The vulnerable component is an HTTP daemon (httpd), which typically listens on network interfaces.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.  
- The exploit is publicly available and presumably straightforward.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely via HTTP request.  
- No mention of needing any privileges or authentication.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is launched remotely by sending a crafted request.  
- No mention of requiring user interaction (e.g., clicking a link).  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the httpd process.  
- Typically, a buffer overflow in a service process can lead to code execution or crash within the same security scope (same process or system component).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope (e.g., no privilege escalation to other components or systems).  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.  
- No explicit mention of data disclosure.  
- However, code execution can lead to data compromise.  
- Since the vulnerability is critical and exploitable remotely, it is reasonable to assume **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing modification of data.  
- Therefore, **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Therefore, **High (H)** availability impact.

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote network attack via HTTP                     |

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to vulnerable component             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Potential full data compromise                      |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Potential full data modification                    |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Potential denial of service or crash                |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Impact Score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (5.88 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (9.77)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in DeShang DSMall up to 5.0.3.
- Affected file: application/home/controller/MemberAuth.php.
- The issue is a path traversal via manipulation of the argument `file_name` (value: '../filedir').
- The attack can be launched remotely.
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack can be launched remotely.
- Path traversal typically exploits web application input parameters.
- Remote exploitation implies Network (N).

**AV = N**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is a straightforward path traversal by manipulating an argument.
- No special conditions or environment needed.
- Public exploit available.
- Therefore, Attack Complexity is Low (L).

**AC = L**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The description does not mention any authentication or privileges needed.
- Path traversal vulnerabilities in web apps often do not require privileges.
- The attacker can send the malicious input remotely without authentication.

**PR = None (N)**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends the malicious input directly.
- No user interaction required for the attack to succeed.

**UI = None (N)**

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is in a web application controller file.
- Path traversal can lead to reading or accessing files outside the intended directory.
- This can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- However, the description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact on other components.
- Usually, path traversal affects the same security scope (the web application).
- So, Scope is Unchanged (U).

**S = U**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Path traversal can allow reading arbitrary files.
- This leads to unauthorized disclosure of information.
- The impact is likely High (H) if sensitive files can be read.
- Since the description is critical and path traversal is often used to read sensitive files, assign High.

**C = H**

---

**Integrity (I):**

- Path traversal typically allows reading files, not modifying them.
- No mention of file modification or data tampering.
- Integrity impact is None (N).

**I = N**

---

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- Path traversal usually does not affect availability.

**A = N**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | Simple path traversal, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | H     | Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)) = 6.42 * (1 - 0.44) = 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.595

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

= round_up(min(3.595 + 3.88, 10)) = round_up(7.475) = 7.5

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **7.5**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5 and 9.0 could provide weaker than expected security for outbound TLS connections caused by a failure to honor user configuration."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The issue is with IBM WebSphere Application Server versions 8.5 and 9.0.
- The problem is that the server provides weaker than expected security for outbound TLS connections.
- The cause is a failure to honor user configuration.
- This suggests that the server might accept weaker TLS settings or cipher suites than intended.
- The vulnerability affects outbound TLS connections, meaning the server initiates connections to other servers or services.
- The description does not mention exploitation complexity, privileges, or user interaction explicitly.
- The impact is on the security of outbound connections, which could lead to confidentiality, integrity, or availability issues depending on the attacker's ability to intercept or manipulate data.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since the vulnerability affects outbound TLS connections, the attacker would likely need to be on the network to intercept or manipulate these connections.  
- The attacker could be remote, as TLS connections are network-based.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to a failure to honor user configuration, which is a design/configuration issue.  
- Exploiting this likely does not require special conditions beyond network access.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges on the server.  
- The attacker likely only needs to be able to interact with the network.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability affects outbound TLS connections initiated by the server.  
- No user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit this.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the security of outbound TLS connections, which are external to the server.  
- However, the vulnerability is within the same security scope (the server's own process and its outbound connections).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Weaker TLS security could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on outbound connections, leading to loss of confidentiality.  
- The impact is likely Low or High depending on the data sensitivity, but since the description says "weaker than expected security," it suggests a significant but not total loss.  
- Assign C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- If the attacker can manipulate outbound TLS connections, they might be able to tamper with data in transit.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention data manipulation.  
- Assign I = Low (L) to reflect possible integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- Assign A = None (N).

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network-based attack on outbound TLS connections |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, affects same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible confidentiality impact due to weaker TLS |
| I      | L     | Possible integrity impact due to weaker TLS |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.6084]  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged (U),  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.52 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.41)  
= 6.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An invalid memory write issue in Jasper-Software Jasper v.4.1.1 and before allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is local ("local attacker").  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity; typically, arbitrary code execution via memory corruption is straightforward once local access is obtained.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is local, but the description does not specify if the attacker needs any privileges. Usually, "local attacker" implies the attacker has at least user-level privileges on the system. Since it doesn't say "no privileges required," we assume Low (L) privileges required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. Usually, local code execution vulnerabilities do not require user interaction.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution locally. Usually, local code execution vulnerabilities affect the same security scope (e.g., the same process or system). No indication that the scope changes.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution typically allows full access to data, so confidentiality impact is High (H).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows full modification of data, so integrity impact is High (H).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt availability (e.g., crash or take over system). Usually, this is High (H).  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

**Impact Sub-Score = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Sub-Score + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(7.71)  
= 7.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact:**  
= 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.22 = 1.412

**Base Score:**  
= Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.412 + 2.068) = Round_up (3.48) = 3.5

  The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted request, which implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL injection typically requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and no mention of needing any privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted request directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows the attacker to obtain sensitive information, but it does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. Usually, SQL injection affects the same scope (database or application).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can obtain sensitive information, so confidentiality is impacted. The description suggests a significant leak but not full system compromise.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modifying data or integrity impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact Sub-Score = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact Sub-Score + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(3.60 + 3.97, 10)) = Roundup(7.57) = 7.6 → 7.6 rounds to 7.6 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

- "The attack can be launched remotely" and the vulnerable CGI script is accessible over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity; buffer overflow via argument manipulation is straightforward.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- The attack is remote and likely unauthenticated.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required for the attack.  
- The attacker can send crafted requests directly.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
= approx 3.89

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.77)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Heap buffer overflow in Skia in Google Chrome prior to 121.0.6167.160 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via a crafted HTML page, which implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network (e.g., by convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to deliver a crafted HTML page. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attacker is remote and can exploit via a crafted HTML page, no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the user to load a crafted HTML page, which implies user interaction is required (e.g., visiting a malicious website).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in Skia, a graphics library used by Chrome. Exploiting this could lead to arbitrary code execution or heap corruption within the browser process. Usually, such vulnerabilities do not affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the browser process).  
  Therefore, the scope is likely **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap buffer overflow can lead to information disclosure (e.g., reading memory). The severity is high, so confidentiality impact is likely **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow an attacker to modify memory, leading to code execution or data modification. Integrity impact is likely **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service. Availability impact is likely **High (H)**.

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.915 = 5.88

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.68, 10))

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"IBM Sterling Secure Proxy 6.0.3 and 6.1.0 could allow an attacker to overwrite a log message under specific conditions."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite a log message.
- Overwriting logs typically impacts **Integrity** (I) of the system.
- The description does not mention confidentiality or availability impacts.
- The phrase "under specific conditions" suggests some complexity or prerequisites.
- No explicit mention of user interaction.
- No explicit mention of privileges required.
- No explicit mention of attack vector, but since this is a network-facing proxy product, likely the attack can be performed remotely.
- No mention of scope change.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
IBM Sterling Secure Proxy is a network proxy product, so the attack is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
**AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
"Under specific conditions" suggests some complexity, but not necessarily high complexity. Usually, "specific conditions" implies some constraints but not high complexity.  
Assuming **AC:L (Low)** because the attacker can overwrite logs if conditions are met, but no indication of high complexity like timing or race conditions.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
No mention of needing privileges. Since it's a proxy product, and the attacker can overwrite logs, likely no privileges required.  
**PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
No mention of user interaction required.  
**UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
Overwriting logs is typically within the same security scope (the proxy application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
**S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
**C:N (None)**

**Integrity (I):**  
Overwriting log messages impacts integrity of logs. The impact is likely low or high depending on the importance of logs. Since logs are critical for auditing, but the description does not mention full compromise or system integrity loss, assign **I:L (Low)**.

**Availability (A):**  
No mention of availability impact.  
**A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22 = 1.32

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(5.23) = 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.318  
= 8.22 × 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936  
= 0.8064

Impact sub-score (Scope Unchanged):

ImpactScore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.8064  
≈ 5.18

**Base Score:**

Since ImpactScore > 0,

BaseScore = round_up(min(ImpactScore + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 2.22, 10))  
= round_up(7.40)  
= 7.4 → 7.4 rounds to 7.4 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

#####173#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel media staging driver for intel-ipu3.
- The issue occurs when an error during set_fmt causes invalid configuration to overwrite previous sizes.
- This leads to v4l2-compliance allocating 4GiB of RAM, causing out-of-memory conditions and kernel crashes (general protection fault).
- The impact is a denial of service (DoS) via system crash (OOPs).

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by a user-space application interacting with the kernel driver via v4l2-compliance tests.  
- This interaction is over the kernel interface, which is local to the machine (not network accessible remotely).  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires triggering a specific error condition during set_fmt.  
- This is a specific sequence but does not require unusual conditions or race conditions.  
- The complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To interact with the media driver and call set_fmt, the attacker likely needs some privileges.  
- Typically, video device nodes are accessible to unprivileged users or users in a specific group.  
- However, since this is a kernel driver, and the vulnerability is triggered by user-space applications, it is likely that **None (N)** or **Low (L)** privileges are required.  
- Given typical Linux permissions for video devices, **Low (L)** is appropriate.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker triggers the vulnerability directly by calling set_fmt.  
- No other user interaction is required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (general protection fault), which affects the entire system.  
- The impact crosses from the vulnerable component (media driver) to the kernel/system.  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No indication of data disclosure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication of data modification or corruption beyond the crash.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The system crashes due to the vulnerability, causing denial of service.  
- This is a **High (H)** impact on availability.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local interaction with kernel driver |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trigger |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (access to video device) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses from driver to kernel/system |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | System crash causes high availability impact |

#####174#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The Advanced AJAX Product Filters WordPress plugin does not sanitise the 'term_id' POST parameter before outputting it in the page, leading to reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered via a POST parameter, which means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Reflected XSS typically requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request.  
- No mention of any special conditions or timing.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to send a POST request with a crafted parameter.  
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Reflected XSS requires the victim to interact, usually by clicking a link or visiting a URL that contains the malicious payload.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin and affects the same security authority (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser.  
- This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality (not full system compromise).  
- Therefore, C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Reflected XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically considered Low impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- Therefore, A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

#####175#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An user enumeration vulnerability in SEO Panel 4.10.0 during authentication. Different error messages reveal whether a username is valid, enabling brute-force attacks with valid usernames.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability occurs during user authentication, which is typically done over the network (e.g., web login). The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack relies on observing different error messages, which is straightforward and does not require special conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is trying to enumerate users before authentication, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is the one performing the attack; no other user needs to interact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the application itself). No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component is described.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  User enumeration leaks information about valid usernames, which is a partial disclosure of information. This is considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No indication that data can be modified or corrupted.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network-based attack |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Partial information disclosure (usernames) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(5.29)  
= 5.3

#####176#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Pega Platform versions 8.2.1 to Infinity 23.1.0 are affected by a Generated PDF issue that could expose file contents."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The issue is related to "Generated PDF" which "could expose file contents."
- This implies an information disclosure vulnerability.
- The exposure of file contents suggests a confidentiality impact.
- No mention of integrity or availability impact.
- The vulnerability affects Pega Platform versions from 8.2.1 to 23.1.0.
- The description does not specify the attack vector explicitly.
- Since it is a platform vulnerability, likely exploitable remotely (network).
- No mention of user interaction or privileges required.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same component.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since the platform is network-facing and the issue is about generating PDFs, it is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- Likely low complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges to exploit.  
- Likely none.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Likely none.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability exposes file contents but does not indicate that it affects components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Likely unchanged.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability "could expose file contents," which is a confidentiality impact.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system compromise.  
- Assign Low or High?  
- Since it exposes file contents, but no indication of total confidentiality loss, assign **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification of data.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network exploitable |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Confidentiality impact due to file exposure |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.87, 10))  
= round_up(5.28) = 5.3 (Medium severity)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

#####177#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in ArtPlacer Widget WordPress plugin before 2.20.7.
- SQL Injection (SQLI) due to lack of sanitization and escaping of the "id" parameter.
- Exploitable by users with editor privileges or above.
- No CSRF check, so exploitation can occur via CSRF against a logged-in editor or above.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves submitting a crafted query to the plugin.  
- Since it is a WordPress plugin, the attack is likely over the network (HTTP request).  
- The attacker can exploit via CSRF, which is a network-based attack.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to lack of sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward.  
- However, the attacker must be an editor or above (privileged user).  
- The lack of CSRF check means the attacker can exploit via CSRF, which is not complex.  
- Overall, the attack complexity is low.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an editor or above.  
- Editors have elevated privileges but are not administrators.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges correspond to privileges that provide basic user capabilities but not administrative.  
- Editors are considered "Low" privileges.  
- **PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack can be performed via CSRF, which requires the victim (editor) to interact with a malicious link or page.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the WordPress plugin itself, and the impact is on the same security scope (the plugin's database).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- The description does not specify the extent of data exposure, but SQLI typically leads to at least some data leakage.  
- Assume **Low (L)** confidentiality impact (some data disclosure).  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data modification, but SQLI often allows it.  
- Assume **Low (L)** integrity impact.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- Assume **None (N)** availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via HTTP/CSRF |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | L     | Requires editor privileges |
| UI     | R     | Requires user interaction (CSRF) |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Some data disclosure possible |
| I      | L     | Some data modification possible |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Roundup (4.583)  
= 4.6 (Medium severity)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####178#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel binder driver.
- The issue is an accounting bug related to async_free_space for small (≤8 bytes) asynchronous transactions.
- The bug causes a small leak of async_free_space (up to 8 bytes) on every such transaction.
- The problem is a logic/accounting error, not a direct memory corruption or code execution.
- The transactions affected are uncommon and small.
- The fix corrects the accounting logic.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the binder driver, which is a kernel IPC mechanism used primarily for communication between processes on the same device.  
- Binder transactions are local IPC calls, not network-facing.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue requires sending small asynchronous transactions (≤8 bytes) to the binder driver.  
- These small transactions are uncommon, and the bug is a corner case.  
- However, no special conditions or race conditions are mentioned.  
- The attacker must be able to send these small transactions, which is straightforward if they have local access.  
- So, the complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To send binder transactions, a process must have the ability to communicate with the binder driver.  
- On Linux, binder is typically accessible to unprivileged processes for IPC.  
- No mention of needing elevated privileges.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can send transactions programmatically; no user interaction is needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects kernel internal accounting.  
- The impact is limited to the binder driver's accounting of async_free_space.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the binder driver or kernel components.  
- The scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The bug causes a small accounting leak of async_free_space, which is a resource management issue.  
- No indication that data confidentiality is affected or that data can be read or leaked.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The bug causes incorrect accounting of free space, which could potentially allow abusive clients to send more transactions than intended.  
- However, no direct indication that data integrity is compromised or that data can be modified.  
- The impact is limited to resource accounting, not data modification.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The leak of async_free_space could lead to resource exhaustion over time if abused.  
- This could degrade or deny service by exhausting async_free_space.  
- The description mentions the leak happens on every small async transaction, so repeated abuse could impact availability.  
- The impact is likely **Low (L)** because the leak is small (up to 8 bytes per transaction) and small transactions are uncommon, so exhaustion would take time.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:N = 0.00
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.306  
≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.52, 10))  
= round_up(3.93)  
= 3.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Path traversal in the static file service in Iodine less than 0.7.33 allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read files outside the public folder via malicious URLs.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and uses malicious URLs, so the attack is over the network.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; path traversal via URL is typically straightforward.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends malicious URLs directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows reading files outside the public folder, but it does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. Reading files outside the public folder is a breach of confidentiality but does not imply a change in scope (e.g., no privilege escalation or impact on other components).  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can read files outside the public folder, which is a confidentiality breach. The impact is likely significant but not total system compromise. Usually, path traversal leads to **Low** or **High** confidentiality impact depending on the files accessible. Since the attacker can read arbitrary files outside the public folder, this is likely **High** confidentiality impact.  
  **C:H (High)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description only mentions reading files, no modification.  
  **I:N (None)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A:N (None)**

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attacker via network (malicious URLs)   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions, straightforward attack  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Unauthenticated attacker                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                     |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the vulnerable component       |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Attacker can read arbitrary files outside public folder |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No modification of files                          |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                           |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N → 0.85  
- AC:L → 0.77  
- PR:N → 0.85 (Scope Unchanged)  
- UI:N → 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H → 0.56  
- I:N → 0.0  
- A:N → 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 1 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1 of:**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score =  
If Scope Unchanged:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in add_reserve.php of Simple Online Hotel Reservation System 1.0.
- Attack vector: Remote (the attack can be initiated remotely).
- Attack complexity: No special conditions mentioned, so likely Low.
- Privileges required: Not mentioned, so likely None.
- User interaction: Not explicitly mentioned, but XSS usually requires the victim user to visit a malicious link or page, so User Interaction is Required.
- Scope: The vulnerability affects the web application itself, no indication that it affects other components or privileges beyond the vulnerable component, so Scope is Unchanged.
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: XSS typically allows attacker to execute scripts in victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies (confidentiality), modifying displayed content (integrity), but usually does not affect availability.

Let's assign values:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
   - Because the attack can be initiated remotely over the network.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
   - No special conditions or timing required.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
   - No privileges needed to exploit.

4. **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
   - Victim must interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).

5. **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
   - The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).

6. **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
   - XSS can lead to disclosure of some information (e.g., cookies), but not full system compromise.

7. **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
   - Attacker can modify displayed content or perform actions on behalf of the user.

8. **Availability (A):** None (N)  
   - No impact on availability.

**Summary of metric values:**

- AV:N  
- AC:L  
- PR:N  
- UI:R  
- S:U  
- C:L  
- I:L  
- A:N

---

**Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:**

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####184#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- A type confusion issue was addressed with improved checks.
- Fixed in various Apple OS versions.
- An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability allows an app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.  
- Since an app (local software) is required to exploit this, the attack is local.  
- **AV:L (Local)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Type confusion vulnerabilities typically require some specific conditions but are generally not high complexity.  
- Given the exploit requires an app to trigger the issue, but no special conditions are mentioned, assume low complexity.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges."  
- This implies the attacker must already have some level of privileges to run an app.  
- However, it is not clear if the app needs to be running as a normal user or with elevated privileges.  
- Usually, an app running as a normal user is "Low" privileges.  
- Since the app is local and presumably running as a normal user, and the vulnerability escalates privileges to kernel level, the PR is Low.  
- **PR:L (Low)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.  
- Since an app can exploit this, it likely does not require additional user interaction beyond running the app.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows code execution with kernel privileges, which is a higher privilege level than the app's user space.  
- This means the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, scope is changed.  
- **S:C (Changed)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges can lead to full system compromise, including confidentiality.  
- So confidentiality impact is High.  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges allows full modification of system and data.  
- Integrity impact is High.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Kernel code execution can lead to system crashes or denial of service.  
- Availability impact is High.  
- **A:H (High)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.52 + 6.88) = Roundup (9.4) = 9.4

#####185#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored XSS via the Role Name field.
- A rogue administrator (i.e., someone with admin privileges) can inject malicious code.
- The malicious code executes when users visit the affected page.
- The attack requires administrator privileges.
- The attack vector is network-based (since users visit a page, and the attacker injects data that is later executed).
- User interaction is required (users must visit the page to trigger the XSS).
- Scope is unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security scope).
- Impact on confidentiality: None (XSS typically does not directly leak confidential data).
- Impact on integrity: Low (the attacker can inject code, potentially altering displayed content).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in AboZain,O7abeeb,UnitOne Custom Dashboard Widgets allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This issue affects Custom Dashboard Widgets: from n/a through 1.3.1.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is a CSRF that allows XSS.
- CSRF means an attacker tricks a user into submitting a request they did not intend.
- The result is an XSS vulnerability, which can lead to code execution in the victim's browser.
- The affected component is a web dashboard widget.
- The attack likely requires the victim to interact with a malicious webpage (user interaction).
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (web-based).
- Privileges required: likely none, since CSRF targets authenticated users but does not require attacker privileges.
- Scope: The vulnerability affects the web application itself, but does it affect components beyond the vulnerable component? Usually, XSS affects the same scope (web app).
- Impact: XSS can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts on the user’s session or data.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (via web).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the victim to visit a malicious page, but this is a common and straightforward attack.  
- No special conditions or environment needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the target system; the attack targets authenticated users but attacker itself has no privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must interact with a malicious webpage or link to trigger the CSRF/XSS.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same web application component (no privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component).  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, potentially altering data or commands.  
- Partial loss of integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via web |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (visit malicious page) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (cookie theft, etc.) |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact (content injection) |

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue discovered in Dronetag Drone Scanner 1.5.2 allows attackers to impersonate other drones via transmission of crafted data packets."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by transmitting crafted data packets. This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Crafting data packets to impersonate drones suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker impersonates other drones by sending crafted packets, implying no prior privileges on the system are needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required for the attack. The attacker sends packets directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The attack impersonates other drones, likely affecting the same security authority or component. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Impersonation may allow the attacker to access information intended for other drones, potentially leading to some information disclosure. However, the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
  Given impersonation, some confidentiality impact is likely.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Impersonation allows the attacker to send false data or commands, which can modify or falsify information. This indicates a low integrity impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 * 0.3916  
= 2.35

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.35 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.24)  
= 6.2

#####188#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Buffer overflow in function formTmultiAP of /bin/boa in Totolink X2000R_V2 firmware 2.0.0-B20230727.10434.
- Severity: Critical
- Impact: Buffer overflow (likely leads to code execution or crash)
- Vendor did not respond.
- No explicit mention of attack vector, complexity, privileges, or user interaction.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in a router firmware binary (/bin/boa).
- Boa is a lightweight HTTP server often used in embedded devices.
- Since it's a router, and the vulnerability is in a web server component, it is likely exploitable remotely over the network.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in web server functions are usually straightforward to exploit if no mitigations are mentioned.
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- Since the vulnerability is in a web server component, and the description does not mention needing authentication or privileges, it is likely exploitable without privileges.
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The vulnerability is in a web server function, likely triggered by sending a specially crafted request.
- No mention of requiring user interaction.
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- Buffer overflow in a system binary can lead to code execution or system compromise.
- If the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component, scope is Changed (C).
- Since the vulnerable component is a system binary (/bin/boa), and exploitation likely leads to system-level impact, scope is Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can compromise confidentiality.
- Given the critical rating, assume High (H).

**Integrity (I):**

- Buffer overflow can allow arbitrary code execution, modifying system files or configurations.
- Therefore, Integrity = High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.
- Therefore, Availability = High (H).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)
- AC: Low (L)
- PR: None (N)
- UI: None (N)
- S: Changed (C)
- C: High (H)
- I: High (H)
- A: High (H)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.85 = 6.987

6.987 * 0.77 = 5.380

5.380 * 0.85 = 4.573

4.573 * 0.85 = 3.887

Exploitability = 3.887

**Impact (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))

= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))

= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)

= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)

= 7.52 * 0.915

= 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

If Impact > 0:

BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

= Roundup (6.88 + 3.887) = Roundup (10.767) = 10.0

- AC:L (Low)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:R (Required)
- S:U (Unchanged)
- C:L (Low)
- I:L (Low)
- A:N (None)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)

= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####190#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"In alac decoder, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect error handling. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation."

---

### Step 1: Attack Vector (AV)  
- The vulnerability is in the "alac decoder," which is typically a software component that processes audio data.  
- The description mentions "remote escalation of privilege," implying the attacker can exploit this remotely.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- The vulnerability is due to "incorrect error handling," which suggests it is straightforward to exploit.  
- User interaction is required, but that affects UI, not AC.  
- So, **Low (L)** complexity.

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)  
- The description says "no additional execution privileges needed," meaning the attacker does not need any privileges before exploitation.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)  
- The description explicitly states "User interaction is needed for exploitation."  
- So, **Required (R)**.

### Step 5: Scope (S)  
- The vulnerability leads to "remote escalation of privilege," which implies the attacker can gain higher privileges than initially allowed.  
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries (from one component or privilege level to another).  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)  
- The description does not mention confidentiality impact.  
- Out of bounds write and privilege escalation typically affect integrity and availability more than confidentiality.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 7: Integrity (I)  
- "Out of bounds write" and "escalation of privilege" imply the attacker can modify data or code.  
- This is a significant impact on integrity.  
- Since it is an escalation of privilege, the impact is likely **High (H)**.

### Step 8: Availability (A)  
- The description does not mention availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

---

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Changed (C)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N

---

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for confirmation)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:C  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0

Calculate Impact:

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56  
= 4.2112

Calculate Exploitability:

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.274 (approx)  
= 2.25 (approx)

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (4.2112 + 2.25), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 6.4612, 10))  
= round_up(min(6.979, 10))  
= 6.98 → 7.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Path traversal and arbitrary file write.
- Affected software: Atril Document Viewer (Linux).
- Impact: Arbitrary file write anywhere the user opening the crafted document has access.
- Limitation: Cannot overwrite existing files.
- Result: Remote Command Execution (RCE) possible.
- Exploitation: By opening a crafted document.
- Versions affected: Prior to 1.26.2.
- Attack vector: Through opening a crafted document (likely over a network or local file).
- Privileges: The user opening the document is the context of the attack.
- User interaction: Required (user must open the crafted document).
- Scope: The vulnerability leads to RCE, which may affect other components beyond the vulnerable component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker must get the victim to open a crafted document.
- The document could be delivered over the network (e.g., email, download) or local file.
- Since the vulnerability is in a document viewer, and the user must open the document, the attack vector is **Network (N)** because the attacker can send the crafted document remotely (e.g., via email or download).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability requires crafting a document that exploits path traversal and arbitrary file write.
- No mention of special conditions or timing.
- The attacker only needs to craft a document and get the user to open it.
- This is a straightforward attack.
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker needs the user to open the document.
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the victim system.
- The attack is performed with the privileges of the user opening the document.
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The user must open the crafted document.
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability leads to Remote Command Execution.
- This implies the attacker can execute code beyond the vulnerable component.
- The scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Arbitrary file write can lead to disclosure if the attacker writes files that expose data.
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.
- However, RCE implies full control.
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- Arbitrary file write allows modification of files.
- RCE implies full integrity compromise.
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**

- RCE can lead to denial of service or system compromise.
- So, **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)
- AC:L (Low)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:R (Required)
- S:C (Changed)
- C:H (High)
- I:H (High)
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:C
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62

= 8.22 * 0.85 = 6.987

6.987 * 0.77 = 5.380

5.380 * 0.85 = 4.573

4.573 * 0.62 = 2.836

**Impact (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]

= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]

= 7.52 * [1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)]

= 7.52 * [1 - 0.085]

= 7.52 * 0.915

= 6.88

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 2.836, 10])

= Roundup (9.716)

= 9.7

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####192#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Product: Dolibarr ERP/CRM version 18.0.4  
- Vulnerability: HTML Injection on the Home page  
- Impact: Allows injection of arbitrary HTML tags, manipulation of rendered content, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.  
- Attack vector: Injection occurs via user-supplied input that is rendered in the web application response.  
- Remediation: Input validation, sanitization, and output encoding.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the web interface (user-supplied input).  
- This means the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to inject HTML tags via input fields; no special conditions or timing required.  
- This is straightforward and does not require complex conditions.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.  
- The injection is on the Home page, likely accessible without login.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker injects HTML that is rendered to other users.  
- For XSS or HTML injection, usually the victim must visit the page to trigger the effect.  
- The attacker does not need user interaction to exploit, but the victim must view the page.  
- According to CVSS, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without the user doing anything, UI is None. If the user must do something (e.g., click a link), UI is Required.  
- Here, the victim must load the page to see the injected content, which counts as user interaction.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- HTML injection can lead to information disclosure if the attacker can manipulate the page to steal data or session tokens.  
- However, the description focuses on HTML injection and potential XSS, which can lead to data theft.  
- Usually, HTML injection alone is considered to have Low confidentiality impact unless it leads to full data disclosure.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, which can manipulate the page content.  
- This is a modification of the integrity of the displayed content.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
- **Value: None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network via web interface.                                   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to exploit.                                                        |
| User Interaction (UI) | R     | Victim must view the page to trigger the effect.                                          |
| Scope (S)             | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope.                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)   | L     | Possible information disclosure via injected content.                                     |
| Integrity (I)         | L     | Content can be manipulated via injected HTML.                                             |
| Availability (A)      | N     | No impact on availability.                                                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged):**  
Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.34)  
= 5.4

#####193#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.224 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)"

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTML page, which implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network (e.g., by convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Usually, out-of-bounds writes in a browser engine that can be triggered by a crafted page are considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the victim system; just visiting a crafted page is enough.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the user to visit a crafted HTML page, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the V8 JavaScript engine, which is part of the browser process. Out-of-bounds write leading to heap corruption could potentially affect other components or processes, but typically, such a vulnerability affects the same security scope (the browser process). Unless explicitly stated, assume scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage. Given the severity is high, some confidentiality impact is likely.  
  Assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow an attacker to modify memory, potentially altering data or code execution. This implies at least a low integrity impact.  
  Assign **Low (L)** for integrity.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service. This implies at least a low availability impact.  
  Assign **Low (L)** for availability.

#####194#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM Maximo Spatial Asset Management 8.10 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). An authenticated attacker can send unauthorized requests from the system, potentially leading to network enumeration or facilitating other attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  SSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to make requests from the vulnerable server to other internal or external systems. The attacker interacts remotely over the network to trigger the SSRF.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated, but no other special conditions or environment constraints are mentioned. SSRF attacks generally have low complexity if authentication is present.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "an authenticated attacker," so some privileges are required, but it does not specify high privileges. Usually, authentication implies Low privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is authenticated and sends requests directly; no mention of needing another user to interact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  SSRF can lead to unauthorized requests from the system, potentially affecting other components or systems beyond the vulnerable component. This suggests the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can perform network enumeration or other attacks, which may lead to information disclosure. This suggests at least a Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description does not explicitly mention modification of data or integrity impact. SSRF typically does not directly modify data but can facilitate other attacks. Without explicit mention, assume no impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Scope (S)            | C      | Vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component                           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Potential information disclosure via network enumeration                                  |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact mentioned                                                             |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) — since Scope is Changed, PR:L = 0.62
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore:**  
Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 1 * 1) = 0.22

Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact Subscore = 7.52 * (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 * (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.22 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.22 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.191 - 3.25 * (0.20)^15  
= 1.436 - negligible (since 0.20^15 is very small) ≈ 1.436

**Base Score:**  
= Roundup(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 * (1.436 + 2.69) = 1.08 * 4.126 = 4.456 ≈ 4.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in num parameter in eyoucms v.1.6.5 allows a remote attacker to run arbitrary code via crafted URL.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted URL, which means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; typically, XSS via crafted URL is straightforward.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit via URL, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, usually the victim must interact by clicking or visiting the crafted URL. So user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary code, but it is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, which typically affects the same security scope (the web application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, which affects integrity. Usually considered Low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= Roundup(5.19) = 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####196#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to the parisc architecture.
- The issue is about stale IIR (Instruction Information Register) values on instruction access rights trap.
- When a trap 7 occurs (due to missing execute permissions), the CPU doesn't fetch the instruction and leaves a stale value in the IIR register.
- The patch overwrites this stale value with a constant to avoid confusion.
- This is essentially an information inconsistency or leakage issue, but no direct indication of code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The issue occurs on a CPU trap related to instruction execution rights.  
- This is a kernel-level issue triggered by executing instructions without proper permissions.  
- The attacker would need to execute code on the system to trigger the trap.  
- This implies **Local (L)** access, as the attacker must have local code execution or local access to trigger the trap.  
- Not Network or Adjacent, since this is CPU internal behavior.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The trap occurs when executing instructions without execute permissions.  
- This is a straightforward condition, no special environment or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To trigger the trap, the attacker must execute instructions that lack execute permissions.  
- This implies the attacker must have some level of code execution or ability to run instructions.  
- Usually, this means at least **Low (L)** privileges (e.g., unprivileged user).  
- Not None, because you need to run code locally.  
- Not High, because root privileges are not necessarily required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No indication that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker triggers the trap by executing instructions.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel's internal CPU trap handler.  
- However, the impact is limited to the kernel's internal register state, no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the kernel or changes privileges.  
- The scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The stale IIR value could leak some stale or random data from the CPU register.  
- This is a minor information leak, but not a direct leak of sensitive data.  
- So, **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data or code.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.24)  
= 3.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A JQuery Unrestricted Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability was discovered in Hospital Management System V4.0 which allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload any file to the server.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload files to the server remotely. Since the attacker is unauthenticated and can exploit this over the network, the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit the vulnerability. Uploading arbitrary files is straightforward. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is **unauthenticated**, meaning no privileges are required. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker uploads files directly; no user interaction is needed. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows uploading files to the server, which likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., server file system or application behavior). This usually means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary file upload can lead to disclosure of information if the attacker uploads a web shell or similar. However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure. Usually, arbitrary file upload primarily impacts integrity and availability, but confidentiality impact is often considered **Low (L)** because the attacker might read files indirectly or gain further access.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Uploading arbitrary files can allow the attacker to modify or add files, which is a direct integrity impact. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  The attacker could upload files that disrupt service (e.g., overwrite critical files or upload malicious scripts). So, **High (H)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
  ≈ 3.88

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - [0.78 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
  = 1 - [0.151]  
  = 0.849

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.849 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.849 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.82 - 3.25 × (0.829)^15  
  = 6.17 - 3.25 × 0.087 (approximate)  
  = 6.17 - 0.28  
  = 5.89

- Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
  = Roundup(Min[5.89 + 3.88, 10])  
  = Roundup(9.77)  
  = 9.8

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Craft CMS Audit Plugin before version 3.0.2 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code during user creation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require the attacker to send crafted input over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests). Since this is a web plugin vulnerability, the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. XSS usually has low complexity if it can be triggered by normal user input.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The vulnerability occurs "during user creation," which suggests the attacker might need to create a user or interact with the user creation process. However, it is not explicitly stated that the attacker must be authenticated or have privileges. Usually, XSS in user creation forms can be exploited by unauthenticated users submitting crafted input.  
  Therefore, assume **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker executes arbitrary code during user creation, which implies the attacker sends the malicious input. The victim (user) does not need to perform any action for the attack to succeed (the attacker controls the input).  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, but it is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, which typically affects the same security scope (the web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). Since it allows arbitrary code execution in the context of the user, confidentiality impact is at least Low.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can modify data or content, so integrity is impacted at least Low.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS typically does not impact availability directly. No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
  **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(3.88 + 2.51) = round_up(6.39) = 6.4

#####199#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
OOB (Out-Of-Bounds) access in paddle.mode in PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0. This flaw can cause a runtime crash and a denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds access in a software library (PaddlePaddle). Since PaddlePaddle is a machine learning framework, it is typically used on a local machine or server. However, the description does not specify remote exploitation or network access. Usually, OOB vulnerabilities in libraries require local code execution or local input.  
  **Assumption:** Local (L) — attacker needs local access to trigger the flaw.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The flaw causes a runtime crash and denial of service due to OOB access. Usually, OOB vulnerabilities are straightforward to trigger if the attacker can supply crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Assumption:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the flaw is in a library function, and no mention of needing elevated privileges, but the attacker likely needs to run code or supply input to the library.  
  If the attacker can run code as an unprivileged user, PR is Low (L). If no privileges are needed, PR is None (N).  
  Given this is a local library function, likely the attacker needs to run code on the system, so PR: Low (L).

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker likely triggers the flaw by running code or inputting data.  
  **Assumption:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The flaw causes a runtime crash and denial of service in the same component (PaddlePaddle). No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries.  
  **Assumption:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The flaw causes a crash and DoS, no mention of data leakage.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The flaw causes a denial of service (runtime crash).  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger OOB |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trigger |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (local user) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service causes high availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.85

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.85, 10))  
= round_up(5.44) = 5.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####200#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's TLS implementation.
- It involves a race condition between asynchronous notification and socket close.
- The issue can cause the submitting thread to access already freed data, leading to potential use-after-free.
- This is a concurrency bug that could lead to memory corruption or crashes.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's TLS code, which is part of the networking stack.  
- The attack likely requires sending specially crafted network packets or data to trigger the race condition.  
- Therefore, the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a race condition, which typically requires precise timing or conditions to exploit.  
- Race conditions are generally considered to have **High** complexity because the attacker must trigger the race reliably.  
- **AC = High (H)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel's TLS code, which processes network data.  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges on the system to send data that triggers the race.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by network activity, no user interaction is needed from a victim user.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, and the impact is on kernel memory (use-after-free).  
- The kernel is a single security authority, so the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.  
- The vulnerability does not cause a privilege escalation or affect other components beyond the kernel.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free in kernel TLS could lead to information disclosure if memory contents are leaked.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention information disclosure, only risk of touching freed data.  
- The impact on confidentiality is likely **Low (L)** because some data might be exposed or corrupted.  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to modify kernel data.  
- This implies a **Low (L)** or possibly **High (H)** impact on integrity.  
- Since the description does not mention full control or arbitrary code execution, but memory corruption, **Low (L)** is appropriate.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The race condition could cause kernel crashes or denial of service.  
- This is a typical impact of use-after-free bugs.  
- So, **Availability impact is Low (L)** (some disruption but not complete system unavailability).  
- **A = Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via TLS |
| AC     | H     | Race condition requires precise timing |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to send network data |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Kernel scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Possible limited info disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible memory corruption |
| A      | L     | Possible denial of service |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.318  
= 8.22 × 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.4746  
= 0.5254

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.5254  
= 3.37

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.37 + 2.22)  
= Round_up (5.59)  
= 5.6

#####201#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia plugin for WordPress, versions up to 1.0.93
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in shortcodes
- Attack scenario: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions can inject arbitrary scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by submitting malicious input via plugin shortcodes, which are processed by the web application.  
- The attacker must be authenticated and have contributor-level permissions, but the injection happens remotely via the web interface.  
- This implies the attack is performed over the network (HTTP requests).  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the required permissions.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor-level is a low privilege but not none.  
- According to CVSS, contributor-level is considered Low privileges.  
- **PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker injects the script, but the script executes when another user accesses the injected page.  
- The victim user must view the page for the script to execute.  
- This means user interaction is required (the victim must access the page).  
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the WordPress plugin and site).  
- The impact is on the same component (plugin/site), no privilege escalation to other components.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim user (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality because it depends on the victim's context.  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify or manipulate data viewed by the victim.  
- This is a Low impact on integrity because the attacker can alter the content seen by users but not necessarily the underlying data or system integrity.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- No indication that the vulnerability causes denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.515 + 2.068, 10))  
= round_up(4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####202#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in function getData of fhs-opensource iparking 1.5.22.RELEASE.
- Attack Vector: The attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Impact: Critical vulnerability (implies high impact).
- No explicit mention of user interaction or privileges required.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack can be initiated remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if no special conditions are required.  
- No mention of complex conditions or environment.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- SQL Injection usually can be exploited without privileges if the input is not sanitized.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- SQL Injection is typically exploited by sending crafted requests directly.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the function getData in the application.  
- SQL Injection typically impacts the same security scope (the application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data leakage.  
- Since the vulnerability is critical, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact (e.g., full data disclosure).  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Critical severity suggests high impact on integrity.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but no explicit mention here.  
- Given critical rating, assume high impact on availability (e.g., data deletion or service disruption).  
- **A:H (High)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack can be initiated remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (data leakage) |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact (data modification) |
| A      | H     | High availability impact (service disruption) |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged) = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 3.97, 10))  
= round_up(9.84) = 9.8 → 9.8 rounds to 9.8 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

- Vulnerability in DedeBIZ 6.3.0, in the Website Copyright Setting component.
- The vulnerability leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- The attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- No vendor response.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to initiate the attack remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if no special conditions are required.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited without privileges.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS typically requires the victim user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page).  
- The description does not explicitly say "no user interaction," so assume user interaction is required.  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user or session hijacking.  
- Usually, XSS is rated as Low impact on confidentiality because it does not directly expose server data but can expose user data.  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts, potentially modifying client-side data or actions.  
- This is typically considered Low impact on integrity.  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore (S:U) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score (S:U):**

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

- Location: systemSettingsDnsDataAction method in SystemSettingsController.php.
- Access: Via the /old/react/v1/api/system/dns/data endpoint.
- Attacker: Authenticated attacker.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution leading to platform compromise.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited over a web endpoint, so the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to be authenticated but no other special conditions are mentioned.  
- Command injection is usually straightforward once authenticated.  
- No mention of timing or environment conditions that increase complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated, so some privileges are required.  
- The description does not specify if the attacker needs low or high privileges, but since it says "authenticated attacker" without specifying admin or high privileges, assume low privileges.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is authenticated and can directly send requests to the endpoint.  
- No mention of needing another user to perform any action.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**

- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.82

2. Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 × 0.915 ≈ 6.88

3. Base Score (Scope Changed):  
BaseScore = 1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability)  
= 1.08 × (6.88 + 2.82)  
= 1.08 × 9.70 ≈ 10.48 → capped at 10.0

#####205#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
In OpenHarmony v3.2.4 and prior versions, a local attacker causes information leak through out-of-bounds read.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is local ("local attacker").  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Out-of-bounds reads typically require some knowledge or conditions but are often straightforward once local access is obtained.  
  Since no special conditions are mentioned, assume Low (L).

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is local, but the description does not specify if any privileges are needed. Since it says "local attacker" and not "privileged local attacker," assume no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker is local and can trigger the issue directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes an information leak via out-of-bounds read. Usually, information leak vulnerabilities do not change scope unless they affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  Assume scope is Unchanged (U).

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Information leak implies confidentiality impact. The severity depends on the amount of data leaked. Since it is an out-of-bounds read causing information leak, but no indication of total system compromise, assign Low (L).

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Information leak (low impact) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |

#####206#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability type: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- Affected component: Add Customer for WooCommerce plugin  
- Impact: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, allowing stored XSS  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS in a web plugin, exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via a crafted HTTP request).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stored XSS typically requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.  
- No indication of complex conditions or timing.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can inject malicious script by adding a customer (input).  
- Usually, adding a customer requires some level of privilege (e.g., admin or shop manager). However, the description does not specify if the attacker must be authenticated or not.  
- Since the description does not mention authentication or privileges, but the action is "Add Customer," which is typically a privileged action in WooCommerce, we assume **Low (L)** privileges required (e.g., shop manager or similar).  
- If it were no privileges, it would be explicitly stated.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For XSS, the attacker injects script that executes in the victim's browser when the victim views the page.  
- The victim must view the stored malicious content for the exploit to succeed.  
- This means user interaction is required (the victim must load the page).  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- Stored XSS affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser.  
- This is typically considered a **Low (L)** confidentiality impact because it depends on the victim's interaction and what data is accessible.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a **Low (L)** integrity impact because the attacker can modify content or perform actions but not directly modify backend data arbitrarily.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 8.22 * 0.201 ≈ 1.65

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 1.65, 10))  
= round_up(4.16)  
= 4.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####207#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Summary:
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via crafted avatar image upload.
- Affected software: Label Studio versions prior to 1.9.2.
- Attack vector: An authenticated user uploads a crafted image file with a `.html` extension that gets rendered as HTML.
- Impact: Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of other users (e.g., Django administrators).
- Exploitation requires authentication.
- User interaction: The victim (e.g., Django admin) must visit the crafted avatar image.
- Scope: The vulnerability allows actions beyond the attacker’s privileges (e.g., adding a new Django Super Administrator user), so scope is likely changed.
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability: Potentially high, since attacker can add admin users (integrity), possibly access sensitive data (confidentiality), and perform malicious actions (availability).

---

### Step 1: Attack Vector (AV)

- The attacker must upload a crafted file to the server.
- The attacker is authenticated, so they have some local access to the application.
- The attack is performed over the network (web interface).
- The attacker uploads a file remotely.
- The victim must visit the crafted avatar image (also over the network).

**Conclusion:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.

**AV = Network (N)**

---

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)

- The attacker must craft a malicious image file with a `.html` extension.
- The client-side validation can be bypassed easily.
- The server uses Django's `serve` view, which is insecure.
- No special conditions or timing required.

**Conclusion:** The attack complexity is low.

**AC = Low (L)**

---

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)

- The attacker must be an authenticated user to upload the avatar image.
- The attacker does not need admin privileges to upload the file.
- The attacker can be a normal authenticated user.

**Conclusion:** Privileges required are Low (authenticated user, but not admin).

**PR = Low (L)**

---

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)

- The attacker uploads the malicious avatar.
- The victim (e.g., Django admin) must visit the crafted avatar image for the XSS to trigger.
- So, user interaction is required from the victim.

**Conclusion:** User interaction is required.

**UI = Required (R)**

---

### Step 5: Scope (S)

- The vulnerability allows the attacker to perform actions beyond their privileges.
- For example, adding a new Django Super Administrator user.
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries.

**Conclusion:** Scope is Changed (C).

**S = Changed (C)**

---

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)

- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim.
- This can lead to theft of sensitive information (e.g., session tokens, data).
- So confidentiality impact is High.

**C = High (H)**

---

### Step 7: Integrity (I)

- The attacker can add a new Django Super Administrator user.
- This is a complete compromise of integrity.

**I = High (H)**

---

### Step 8: Availability (A)

- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact.
- However, arbitrary JavaScript execution could potentially disrupt availability.
- Given the severity of other impacts, and typical XSS impact, availability impact is likely Low (some disruption possible but not complete denial).

**A = Low (L)**

---

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| AV     | N      | Remote network attack via web interface |
| AC     | L      | Easy to exploit, no special conditions |
| PR     | L      | Requires authenticated user, not admin |
| UI     | R      | Victim must visit crafted avatar image |
| S      | C      | Impact crosses privilege boundaries |
| C      | H      | Arbitrary JS can leak sensitive info |
| I      | H      | Attacker can add admin user (full integrity loss) |
| A      | L      | Possible disruption but no full denial |

---

**Step 1: Calculate Impact**

Impact = 7.52 * [ (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) ]

= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56)*(1 - 0.56)*(1 - 0.22)]

= 7.52 * [1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78)]

= 7.52 * [1 - 0.1509]

= 7.52 * 0.8491 = 6.39

**Step 2: Calculate Exploitability**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.3844

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.296

= 8.22 * 0.251

= 2.06

**Step 3: Calculate Base Score**

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = round_up (min (1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))

= 1.08 * (6.39 + 2.06) = 1.08 * 8.45 = 9.13

Rounded up to 9.2

#####208#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in GTKWave 3.3.115.
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted `.vzt` file.
- The attack vector involves a victim opening a malicious file.
- The integer overflow can lead to memory corruption.
- The vulnerability concerns the integer overflow when `num_time_ticks` is zero.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must deliver a malicious file that the victim opens.  
- The attack is not remote network-based but requires the victim to open a file locally.  
- This is typically considered **Local (L)** because the attacker cannot exploit it remotely without user action on the local machine.  
- However, if the file can be delivered over the network (e.g., email attachment), sometimes **Adjacent (A)** or **Network (N)** is considered.  
- But since the victim must open the file, and the file must be on the victim's machine, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted file, but no special conditions or environment are required beyond opening the file.  
- This is a straightforward exploit once the file is opened.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The victim must open the file, but no privileges are required to open a file.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to memory corruption within the GTKWave application.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
- Integer overflow leading to memory corruption can sometimes cause partial data exposure.  
- Given the uncertainty, assign **Low (L)** to reflect some potential confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can allow modification of data or code execution.  
- So, **Low (L)** is appropriate.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

#####209#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The WP Review Slider WordPress plugin before 13.0 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by a high privilege user (admin) through the plugin settings.  
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface, which is typically local or adjacent network depending on context. However, WordPress admin access is usually via network (web interface).  
- Since the attacker must be an authenticated user accessing the admin panel over the network, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires the attacker to have high privileges and knowledge of the plugin settings.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond having admin access.  
- Complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a high privilege user such as admin.  
- This corresponds to **High (H)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the admin user performing the attack themselves (stored XSS via settings).  
- No other user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stored XSS, which can affect other users viewing the site.  
- This means the impact crosses from the vulnerable component (plugin) to other components (site visitors' browsers).  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)

- PR:H (0.27 when Scope is Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 7.52 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [2.95 + 1.23, 10])  
= Roundup (4.18) = 4.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: FOX – Currency Switcher Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress, versions up to 1.4.1.5
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
- Attackers: Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above
- Impact: Inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via the web interface.  
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin or subscriber interface, which is typically over the network (HTTP).  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with subscriber-level access or above.  
- Subscriber is a low-privilege role in WordPress, not admin.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" means privileges that provide basic user capabilities but not administrative.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires a victim user to visit the injected page for the script to execute.  
- The attacker injects the script, but the victim must load the page for the impact to occur.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the WordPress application).  
- The impact is limited to the application itself, no privilege escalation beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the victim user.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of the victim.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.

Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
HTTP3 dissector crash in Wireshark 4.2.0 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Denial of Service (DoS) via crash.
- **Component:** HTTP3 dissector in Wireshark.
- **Attack vector:** Packet injection or crafted capture file.
- **Impact:** Crash (availability impact).
- **Privileges:** Not explicitly stated, but Wireshark typically runs with user privileges and processes packets from the network or files.
- **User interaction:** Not explicitly stated, but likely none for packet injection; for crafted capture file, user must open the file.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Packet injection implies network-based attack.  
- Crafted capture file requires user to open the file (local file).  
Since packet injection is possible, the attacker can send packets over the network.  
**AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The crash occurs via crafted packets or files.  
- No special conditions or timing required are mentioned.  
- Packet injection or crafted file is straightforward.  
**AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Wireshark runs with user privileges, no elevated privileges needed to trigger the crash.  
- Attacker does not need any privileges on the victim system to send packets or provide a crafted file.  
**PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For packet injection, no user interaction needed.  
- For crafted capture file, user must open the file in Wireshark.  
Since either vector is possible, and the description includes packet injection (no UI), we take the least restrictive.  
**UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The crash affects Wireshark process itself.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The impact is on the same security scope (Wireshark process).  
**S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of data disclosure.  
- DoS does not affect confidentiality.  
**C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification.  
- DoS does not affect integrity.  
**I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Crash causes denial of service.  
- This impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely high since Wireshark crashes.  
**A = High (H)**

### Step 3: Summary of metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Packet injection over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to Wireshark process |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Crash causes high availability impact |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.47) = 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) was found to be susceptible to a Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. If exploited, this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to achieve Remote Code Execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by an unauthenticated user. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Directory Traversal leading to Remote Code Execution typically does not require complex conditions or timing. The description does not mention any special conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any need for user interaction. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Remote Code Execution usually affects resources beyond the vulnerable component, potentially impacting the entire system. However, since the vulnerability is in SolarWinds ARM and leads to RCE, the scope is likely changed (the impact crosses security boundaries).  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Remote Code Execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  RCE allows an attacker to modify data or system state arbitrarily.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  RCE can also disrupt system availability (e.g., by deleting files, stopping services).  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
   = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
   ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
   ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
   ≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
   ≈ 3.88

2. Impact Sub-Score (Scope Changed):  
   ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
   = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
   = 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
   = 1 - 0.085  
   = 0.915

3. Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
   = 7.52 × (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
   = 7.52 × 0.886 - 3.25 × (0.895)^15  
   = 6.66 - 3.25 × 0.142  
   = 6.66 - 0.46  
   = 6.20

4. Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
   = Roundup(Min(6.20 + 3.88, 10))  
   = Roundup(10.08)  
   = 10.0

#####214#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Advanced iFrame WordPress plugin.
- Affected versions: up to and including 2023.10.
- Cause: insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes.
- Attackers: authenticated users with contributor-level and above permissions.
- Impact: injection of arbitrary web scripts that execute when any user accesses the injected page.

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via the plugin's shortcode.  
- The injection happens through the web interface (plugin shortcode attributes).  
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface (contributor-level or above).  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (HTTP requests to WordPress).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level permissions.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond normal contributor access.  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor is a low-level privilege in WordPress but not none.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The injected script executes when any user accesses the injected page.  
- The attacker does not need the victim to perform any action other than viewing the page.  
- The attacker must perform the injection, but the victim user only needs to view the page.  
- According to CVSS, UI refers to whether the attacker needs the victim to do something.  
- Here, the victim must view the page, so UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the plugin and the WordPress site.  
- The impact is on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the WordPress site or users.  
- The vulnerability allows script execution in the context of other users, potentially affecting other components beyond the plugin itself.  
- This is a typical case of scope change because the vulnerability allows impact beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (plugin).  
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
- C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying content or performing actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a high impact on integrity.  
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not directly affect availability.  
- No indication that availability is impacted.  
- A = None (N).

---

### Summary of Metric Values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: L (Low)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: N (None)

- Successful exploitation allows stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- Web interface is typically accessible over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply specially crafted input; no special conditions or environment needed.  
- No mention of timing or other complex conditions.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and can supply input to the web interface.  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Stored XSS requires a victim user to visit the page or trigger the malicious script.  
- The attacker does not need user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, but the impact (execution of script) requires a user to load the malicious content.  
- According to CVSS guidelines, if exploitation requires a user to trigger the attack (e.g., victim visiting a page), UI is Required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application on the router).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS allows attacker to execute scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- No mention of DoS or availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[2.51 + 2.82, 10])  
= Roundup(5.33) = 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.3

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **5.3 (Medium severity)**.

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####217#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
- Affected software: Snow Software Inventory Agent on MacOS, Windows, Linux
- Impact: Allows File Manipulation through Snow Update Packages
- Versions affected: Inventory Agent through 6.12.0, 6.14.5, 6.7.2

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability involves manipulation through update packages, which are typically delivered over the network (e.g., via update servers). Since the attacker can exploit this remotely by sending malicious update packages, the vector is likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Improper verification of cryptographic signatures usually means the attacker can craft malicious update packages that bypass signature checks. This typically does not require special conditions or timing, so the complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
Since the attacker can manipulate update packages, which are usually downloaded and installed by the software itself, the attacker likely does **not** need any privileges on the target system to exploit this. So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
Does the user need to do anything? Since this is about update packages, which are often installed automatically or with minimal user interaction, but sometimes require user approval. The description does not specify user interaction is required. Assuming automatic update or no user interaction needed, so **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component? Since file manipulation is possible through update packages, this could affect the entire system or other components beyond the Inventory Agent itself. This suggests **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
File manipulation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information if files are replaced or read. However, the description only mentions file manipulation, not direct data disclosure. So, likely **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
File manipulation directly impacts integrity, as files can be altered or replaced. This is likely **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
File manipulation could cause denial of service if critical files are replaced or corrupted. The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but file manipulation can cause availability issues. Assigning **Low (L)** availability impact.

| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible limited data disclosure                                                          |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | File manipulation directly impacts integrity                                              |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.267)  
= 7.52 * 0.733  
= 5.51

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [5.51 + 3.89, 10])  
= Roundup (9.4)  
= 9.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in Atos Unify OpenScape Xpressions WebAssistant V7 before V7R1 FR5 HF42 P911. It allows path traversal."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Path traversal vulnerability  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to access files/directories outside the intended directory.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a web assistant, the attack is likely performed remotely over the network.  
- **Privileges Required:** Usually, path traversal vulnerabilities do not require authentication unless specified. Since not mentioned, assume **None**.  
- **User Interaction:** Typically, no user interaction is required for path traversal attacks.  
- **Scope:** Path traversal can lead to unauthorized access to files, but does it affect resources beyond the vulnerable component? Usually, path traversal affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application). So, **Scope: Unchanged**.  
- **Impact:**  
  - **Confidentiality:** High, because unauthorized files can be read.  
  - **Integrity:** Usually none or low, since path traversal typically allows reading files, not modifying them. No mention of modification, so **Integrity: None**.  
  - **Availability:** None, no indication that availability is affected.

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**       | N     | Network, since it is a web application vulnerability accessible remotely.                   |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)**   | L     | Low, path traversal usually does not require special conditions.                            |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | N     | None, no mention of needing authentication.                                               |

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Reflected XSS is typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via a crafted URL).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS usually requires the attacker to craft a malicious link and lure a user to click it, but no special conditions or environment are needed. This is considered low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges to perform the attack; the vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can send a crafted request.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Reflected XSS requires the victim to click a malicious link or interact with the crafted input.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). It does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Reflected XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user, such as session tokens or other sensitive data. This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Reflected XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that may modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, but it does not directly modify server-side data. Usually, this is considered **Low** impact on integrity.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

### Step 3: Construct the CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

---

### Step 4: Calculate the Base Score (optional)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(2.52 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.34) = 5.3

---

### Final result:

- **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 5.3 (Medium severity)  
- **Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: WordPress plugin "Email Encoder – Protect Email Addresses and Phone Numbers"
- Attack vector: via shortcode attributes (user-supplied)
- Attacker: authenticated users with contributor-level and above permissions
- Impact: injection of arbitrary scripts executed when a user accesses the page
- User interaction: the victim must access the injected page for the script to execute

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely by submitting crafted shortcode attributes.  
- The attacker must be authenticated and submit data that is stored and later rendered.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests to WordPress).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping.  
- The attacker only needs to supply crafted input via shortcode attributes.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor-level is a low privilege but not none.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" means some privileges but not administrative.  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The injected script executes when a user accesses the injected page.  
- The attacker cannot trigger the script execution themselves; a victim must view the page.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin and its data).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive info.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- Therefore, Integrity = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- No indication of DoS or resource exhaustion.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.05) = round_up(4.56) = 4.6 (Medium severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Use After Free in Arm Ltd Bifrost and Valhall GPU Kernel Drivers.
- Exploitation: Local non-privileged user can exploit a race condition.
- Impact: Improper memory processing leading to use-after-free.
- Affected components: Kernel drivers.
- Privileges: Local user, non-privileged.
- Attack vector: Local user must prepare system memory carefully.
- User interaction: Not explicitly mentioned.
- Scope: Not explicitly mentioned, but kernel driver is involved, so potential for scope change.
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability: Not explicitly detailed, but use-after-free can lead to arbitrary code execution or system crash.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker is a local user.
- The vulnerability requires local access.
- So, AV = Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The description says "If the system’s memory is carefully prepared by the user," indicating some complexity.
- This suggests the attack is not trivial and requires specific conditions.
- So, AC = High (H)

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is a "local non-privileged user."
- So, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention of user interaction required.
- The attacker is the local user exploiting the race condition.
- So, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is in the kernel driver.
- Use-after-free in kernel drivers can lead to privilege escalation or system compromise.
- The description does not explicitly say the scope changes, but since the attacker is local non-privileged and can exploit kernel driver, the impact likely crosses privilege boundaries.
- Therefore, Scope = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure.
- The description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact.
- However, kernel memory corruption can lead to information disclosure.
- Assign Confidentiality = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**

- Use-after-free can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of memory.
- So, Integrity = High (H)

**Availability (A):**

- Use-after-free can cause system crashes or denial of service.
- So, Availability = High (H)

| Scope (S)            | C      | Kernel driver vulnerability likely changes scope (privilege escalation).                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible information disclosure due to memory corruption.                                 |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | High impact on integrity due to memory corruption and potential code execution.            |
| Availability (A)     | H      | High impact on availability due to potential system crashes.                              |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.318  
= 8.22 × 0.1749  
≈ 1.438

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.78 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.151]  
= 7.52 × 0.849  
= 6.39

Since Scope is Changed (C), the formula for Impact is:

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
ImpactScore = 7.52 × 0.849 = 6.39

**Base Score:**

BaseScore = RoundUp (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= RoundUp (Minimum [6.39 + 1.438, 10])  
= RoundUp (7.828)  
= 7.8

#####222#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
TOTOLINK A3300R V17.0.0cu.557_B20221024 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the enable parameter in the setPortForwardRules function.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a command injection via a parameter in a function (setPortForwardRules).  
- This likely means the attacker can send crafted input over the network to exploit it.  
- Since it's a router and the function is related to port forwarding, it is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Command injection vulnerabilities typically require low complexity if no special conditions are needed.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or prerequisites.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a function related to port forwarding rules, which might require authentication or not.  
- The description does not specify if authentication is required.  
- However, many routers require authentication to change port forwarding rules.  
- But if the vulnerability is exploitable without authentication, PR would be None (N).  
- Since the description does not specify authentication, but the function name suggests configuration changes, assume **Low (L)** privileges required (e.g., user-level access).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Command injection via a parameter in a function suggests no user interaction is needed.  
- The attacker sends the malicious input directly.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Command injection typically allows execution of commands on the vulnerable component.  
- If the vulnerability allows control beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., affects other components), scope is Changed (C).  
- In routers, command injection often leads to full control of the device, which is the vulnerable component itself.  
- No indication that the scope changes beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command injection can lead to full control, including reading sensitive data.  
- So confidentiality impact is High (H).  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Command injection allows arbitrary command execution, so integrity is High (H).  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Command injection can disrupt services or cause denial of service.  
- Availability impact is High (H).  
- **Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with these values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(8.55) = 8.6 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to nearest 0.1, but the official calculator rounds to 9.0)

#####223#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The WP User Profile Avatar WordPress plugin before 1.0.1 does not properly check for authorization, allowing authors to delete and update arbitrary avatars.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows authors (authenticated users with author privileges) to delete and update arbitrary avatars. Since authors are authenticated users, the attack is not from the network directly without authentication, but from within the application by an authenticated user.  
  WordPress plugins are typically accessed over the network (web interface), but the attacker must be an author (authenticated user). So the attack vector is **Network (N)** because the attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via the web interface.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description suggests a straightforward authorization bypass for authors. No special conditions or timing required. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be an author (authenticated user with author privileges). This is a **Low (L)** privilege level (not None, not High).

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is an author exploiting the vulnerability directly. No other user interaction is required. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows modification of avatars, which are part of the same security scope (the WordPress application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability allows deletion and update of avatars, which are images associated with user profiles. This does not disclose confidential information. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can delete and update arbitrary avatars, which is a modification of data. This is a **Low (L)** impact on integrity (modification of non-critical data).

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected. So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote network attack via web interface         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward authorization bypass            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires author privileges (low)                 |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                      |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Same security scope                               |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                         |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Modification of avatars (low integrity impact)   |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                            |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 * 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 * 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 * 0.85 = 2.836

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore (since Scope is Unchanged)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.412

**Base Score:**  
= Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= Roundup(Min(1.412 + 2.836, 10))  
= Roundup(4.248) = 4.3

- Value: **Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description states "insufficient escaping" and "lack of sufficient preparation," implying the attack is straightforward and does not require special conditions.  
- Value: **Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated and does not need any privileges.  
- Value: **None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.48) = 7.5

#####225#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in OpenNDS before 10.1.3. It fails to sanitize the FAS key entry in the configuration file, allowing attackers that have direct or indirect access to this file to execute arbitrary OS commands."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of a configuration file entry.
- Attackers must have direct or indirect access to the configuration file.
- Exploitation leads to arbitrary OS command execution.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker needs access to the configuration file.  
- The description does not say the attacker can exploit remotely over the network.  
- Access to the file implies local or adjacent access.  
- Since the file is local to the system, and no network or adjacent network access is mentioned, the vector is likely **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must have access to the file and exploit the unsanitized input.  
- No mention of any special conditions or timing, so complexity is likely **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have access to the configuration file.  
- Access to the config file usually requires some privileges, but the description does not specify if the attacker needs elevated privileges or just user-level access.  
- Since it says "direct or indirect access," it implies the attacker already has some level of access to the system.  
- Usually, access to configuration files requires at least user-level privileges.  
- So, **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required for exploitation.  
- The attacker can execute commands by manipulating the config file.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary OS commands.  
- This likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., system-level impact).  
- So, the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution allows modification of data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can disrupt system availability.  
- So, **High (H)**.

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local access to config file                                                      |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed                                                              |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires some privileges to access config file                                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                                              |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Arbitrary OS command execution affects system beyond vulnerable component                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Full system compromise possible                                                           |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Full system compromise possible                                                           |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Full system compromise possible                                                           |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.246  
≈ 2.02

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 * 0.915  
= 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact > 0:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (6.88 + 2.02), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 8.9, 10))  
= round_up(9.61)  
= 9.6 → 9.6 rounds to 9.6 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

#####226#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Modem IMS Call UA.
- Possible out of bounds write due to missing bounds check.
- Could lead to remote denial of service.
- No additional execution privileges needed.
- User interaction is not needed.
- Exploitation is remote.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely ("remote denial of service").  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of any special conditions or complexity.  
- The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check, which is straightforward.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- "No additional execution privileges needed."  
- This implies no privileges are required.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a denial of service in the modem component.  
- Usually, a denial of service in the same component means the scope is unchanged.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention any data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, C = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
- Therefore, I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability can lead to denial of service.  
- Denial of service impacts availability.  
- The description says "remote denial of service" but does not specify the severity.  
- Usually, an out-of-bounds write causing a crash is considered High impact on availability.  
- Therefore, A = High (H).

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote exploitation possible |
| AC     | L     | Simple missing bounds check |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service impact is high |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####227#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in ABO.CMS v.5.9.3 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the Referer header.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by sending a crafted payload to the Referer header, which is part of HTTP headers. This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Sending a crafted payload to the Referer header is straightforward.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP header, no mention of needing any privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For Cross Site Scripting (XSS), typically the victim must interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link) for the payload to execute. However, this description says "allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the Referer header." Since the Referer header is sent by the client (browser) when visiting a page, the attacker must trick a user into visiting a malicious link or site that sends the crafted Referer header. This implies user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, but it is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability within the same application context. Usually, XSS vulnerabilities do not change scope because the impact is within the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). The description says "execute arbitrary code," which can lead to high confidentiality impact. However, since it's XSS, the impact is usually limited to the user's browser context, not the server's data. So, confidentiality impact is typically Low (L).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution in the browser can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, so integrity is impacted.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS usually does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network via HTTP header                                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                                                                      |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must visit a crafted link or page to trigger the payload                             |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact is within the same security scope                                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible disclosure of sensitive info via XSS                                            |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of data or actions via XSS                                         |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.69)  
= round_up(5.20)  
= 5.2

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####228#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The vulnerability is in the Nextcloud User Saml app.
- Users can be given a link to the Nextcloud server but end up on an uncontrolled third-party server.
- This suggests some form of redirection or open redirect vulnerability.
- No mention of authentication bypass or privilege escalation.
- No mention of user interaction explicitly, but since users are "given a link," user interaction is likely required.
- The vulnerability involves users being redirected to a third-party server, which may impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the original system or user data.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The issue involves users clicking a link, which is typically delivered over the network.  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely by sending a crafted link.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- The attacker just needs to provide a crafted link.  
- So, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "users can be given a link," implying no privileges are needed to exploit.  
- So, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must click the link to be redirected.  
- So, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes the user to be redirected to an uncontrolled third-party server.  
- This is a change in the security scope because the impact moves outside the original system boundary (from Nextcloud server to third-party server).  
- So, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
- However, redirecting users to a malicious third-party server could lead to phishing or data theft, but this is indirect.  
- Since the vulnerability itself does not directly disclose data from the Nextcloud server, confidentiality impact is likely Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or tampering.  
- Redirecting users does not directly affect integrity of data on the Nextcloud server.  
- So, I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over the network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must click the link |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security boundaries (redirect to third-party) |
| C      | L     | Potential low confidentiality impact due to phishing risk |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) because Scope is Changed
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 7.52 × 0.22 ≈ 1.65

Because Scope is Changed:

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
Impact = 7.52 × 0.22 = 1.65

**Base Score Calculation:**

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [1.65 + 2.68, 10])  
= Roundup (4.33) = 4.3

Since Scope is Changed and Impact is low, the score is moderate.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
In Splunk Add-on Builder versions below 4.1.4, the app writes sensitive information to internal log files.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The app writes sensitive information to internal log files.
- This is an information disclosure issue.
- The vulnerability involves exposure of sensitive data (confidentiality impact).
- No indication of integrity or availability impact.
- The vulnerability is in the app itself, so the attacker likely needs to interact with the app.
- The description does not specify if the attacker needs privileges or user interaction.
- The vulnerability is about writing sensitive info to logs, which could be accessed by an attacker.
- The attack vector is likely local or adjacent, depending on how the attacker accesses the logs.
- Since the logs are internal, probably local or adjacent.
- No indication that the scope changes (the vulnerability affects the same security authority).

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves writing to internal logs.  
- To exploit, attacker likely needs access to the system or app environment.  
- Not network accessible directly (no mention of remote exploitation).  
- Could be Local (L) or Adjacent (A).  
- Adjacent means attacker is on the same network segment. Local means attacker has local access (e.g., local user or process).  
- Since it's an app writing logs internally, and no mention of network access, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- Writing sensitive info to logs is straightforward once the app runs.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Does the attacker need privileges?  
- Since the app writes logs internally, the attacker likely needs to be able to run or interact with the app.  
- If the attacker is a local user or process, they may need some privileges.  
- The description does not specify if the attacker needs privileges or if this is exploitable by an unprivileged user.  
- Since the app writes logs internally, and the attacker needs to access those logs, likely **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does the attacker need user interaction?  
- The description does not mention user interaction.  
- The app writes logs automatically.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- The app writes sensitive info to its own logs.  
- No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Sensitive information is written to logs.  
- This is an information disclosure.  
- The impact is likely **High (H)** because sensitive info is exposed.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local access to the system/app.                                  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed.                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Attacker needs low privileges to access or trigger the logging.           |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                             |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the vulnerable component.                               |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 1 × 1)  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.42) = 5.4 → 5.4 rounds to 5.4 (CVSS scores are rounded to one decimal place)

#####230#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via imported form titles.
- Affected software: Contact Form Plugin – Fastest Contact Form Builder Plugin for WordPress by Fluent Forms, versions ≤ 5.1.5.
- Attack vector: Injection of scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with administrator-level access.
- Scope: Affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html is disabled.
- Impact: Injection of arbitrary web scripts, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the script's payload.
- User interaction: The script executes when a user accesses the injected page (so user interaction is required to trigger the payload).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker injects scripts via imported form titles.
- The injection happens through the plugin interface, which is web-based.
- The attacker must be authenticated with admin privileges.
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (web interface).
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
- The attacker must have admin access and import malicious form titles.
- No special conditions or race conditions are mentioned.
- The attack complexity is low because once admin access is obtained, the injection is straightforward.
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level access.
- Administrator-level access is considered High privileges.
- PR = High (H).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The script executes when a user accesses the injected page.
- So, user interaction is required (the victim must visit the page).
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the plugin and WordPress installation).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- This is a typical confidentiality impact.
- The impact is likely Low or High depending on the payload.
- Since the attacker is admin and can inject arbitrary scripts, the impact can be High.
- C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can inject scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.
- This can lead to modification of data or settings.
- Integrity impact is High.
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- XSS typically does not directly affect availability.
- However, scripts could be crafted to cause denial of service.
- No explicit mention of availability impact.
- Assume None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack performed remotely over the network via web interface.                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions; straightforward injection once admin access is obtained.           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| H   | Requires administrator-level access.                                                      |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must visit the injected page to trigger the script.                                  |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope.                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Arbitrary script execution can lead to full confidentiality compromise.                    |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Arbitrary script execution can lead to full integrity compromise.                          |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No direct impact on availability mentioned.                                               |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Explaining PR:H (Scope Unchanged):**

- For Scope Unchanged, PR:H = 0.27

---

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.27 = 1.452  
1.452 × 0.62 = 0.900

Exploitability ≈ 0.90

---

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936  
= 0.8064

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.8064  
= 5.18

---

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (5.18 + 0.90)  
= Round_up (6.08)  
= 6.1

---

### Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.1 (Medium severity)

#####231#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
"EDK2 is susceptible to a vulnerability in the Tcg2MeasureGptTable() function, allowing a user to trigger a heap buffer overflow via a local network. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The description says "via a local network."  
- "Local network" implies the attacker must be on the same local network segment, not remote over the internet.  
- According to CVSS definitions:  
  - Network (N): The vulnerability is exploitable from anywhere on the internet or large network.  
  - Adjacent (A): The attacker must be on the same shared physical or logical network (e.g., local network).  
  - Local (L): Requires local system access.  
  - Physical (P): Requires physical interaction.  
- "Local network" fits Adjacent (A).  
**AV = A**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- Heap buffer overflow triggered by a user on the local network.  
- Usually, if no special conditions are mentioned, AC is Low.  
**AC = L**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- "Allowing a user to trigger a heap buffer overflow via a local network."  
- The phrase "a user" is ambiguous but likely means an unprivileged user on the local network.  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have elevated privileges.  
- Since the attacker is on the local network, but no mention of needing privileges, assume PR = None.  
**PR = N**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that the user must interact with the victim.  
- The attacker triggers the overflow directly.  
- So, no user interaction required.  
**UI = N**

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in EDK2, which is firmware-related.  
- Heap buffer overflow could lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- Usually, firmware vulnerabilities that allow compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability imply the scope is Changed (C).  
- Because the vulnerability can affect system-wide security properties beyond the vulnerable component, Scope = Changed.  
**S = C**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- "May result in a compromise of confidentiality."  
- So, confidentiality impact is at least Low.  
- Since it says "compromise," but no explicit mention of total data disclosure, assume Low.  
**C = L**

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- "May result in a compromise of integrity."  
- Same reasoning as confidentiality.  
- Assume Low.  
**I = L**

---

**Availability (A):**  
- "May result in a compromise of availability."  
- Assume Low.  
**A = L**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Exploitable from local network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact affects beyond vulnerable component |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Partial availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:A (0.62)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.345  
= approx 2.84

**Impact Sub-Score (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22)*(1 - 0.22)*(1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 7.52 * 0.526  
= approx 3.95

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else:  
Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.84 + 3.95)  
= Roundup (6.79)  
= 6.8

#####232#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: CrateDB distributed SQL database
- Vulnerable function: COPY FROM (imports file data into database tables)
- Vulnerability: Authenticated attackers can use COPY FROM to import arbitrary file content into database tables, resulting in information leakage.
- Impact: Information leakage (confidentiality impact)
- Attackers: Authenticated (requires privileges)
- Attack vector: Likely network (since it's a database function accessible remotely)
- User interaction: Not mentioned, likely none
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but the impact is on the same system (database), so scope likely unchanged

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The COPY FROM function is a database function, typically accessible over the network by clients.  
- Since attackers are authenticated users connecting to the database, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to be authenticated but no special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
- The flaw allows arbitrary file content import, which seems straightforward once authenticated.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated to use the COPY FROM function.  
- The description says "authenticated attackers," but does not specify if low or high privileges are needed.  
- COPY FROM is a data import function, likely requiring at least some low-level privileges (e.g., ability to run COPY FROM).  
- Since it is not stated that admin or high privileges are required, assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required beyond the attacker themselves.  
- The attacker is the one performing the action.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability results in information leakage within the database.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability results in information leakage.  
- The description says "information leakage," which corresponds to **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on the severity.  
- Since arbitrary file content can be imported into tables, it could expose sensitive data.  
- However, the description does not say full system compromise or total data disclosure.  
- Assume **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability allows importing arbitrary file content into tables, which could affect data integrity.  
- However, the description focuses on information leakage, not data modification or corruption.  
- So, **None (N)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)** availability impact.

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the vulnerable component                                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Information leakage, but not total disclosure                                             |

| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact mentioned                                                          |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 8.22 × 0.275 ≈ 2.26

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 × 1 × 1) = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22 = 1.41

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 2.26) = Round_up (3.67) = 3.7

#####233#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS.
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- The attack allows performing arbitrary actions on the affected device.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and unauthenticated.  
- CSRF attacks typically require the attacker to trick a user into submitting a request from their browser, but the attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- The attack is conducted over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the attacker to trick a user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious page).  
- This requires some user interaction and is not trivial but also not highly complex.  
- According to CVSS guidelines, if an attack requires user interaction or specific conditions, AC is usually High (H).  
- However, CSRF attacks are generally considered to have Low complexity because the attacker only needs to lure the user to a malicious page.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
**Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- CSRF attacks require the user to perform some action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious website).  
**Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary actions on the affected device itself.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, scope is Unchanged (U).  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention data disclosure.  
- The attacker can perform arbitrary actions but not necessarily read confidential data.  
- So, confidentiality impact is Low (L) or None (N).  
- Since arbitrary actions could include reading some data, but no explicit mention, we assume Low (L).  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary actions imply the attacker can modify data or settings.  
- This is a High impact on integrity.  
**Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- Arbitrary actions could include disrupting service, but no explicit mention.  
- Assume None (N) or Low (L).  
- To be conservative, assume Low (L) because arbitrary actions could affect availability.  
**Value:** Low (L)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged):**  
Impact = 6.42 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.267]  
= 6.42 * 0.733 ≈ 4.71

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.71 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(7.53) = 7.5

#####234#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Input Validation in Hitron Systems DVR LGUVR-4H 1.02~4.02 allows an attacker to cause network attack in case of using default admin ID/PW."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is described as a "network attack," so the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack requires the use of default admin credentials, which is a common misconfiguration but not difficult to exploit if those credentials are known or default. This suggests low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must have the default admin ID/PW to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker needs to authenticate as admin, this implies some privileges are required, but since the credentials are default and likely known, this is considered Low privileges rather than None or High.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  There is no indication that any user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. The attacker uses default credentials to directly exploit the vulnerability.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The description does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes the security scope. It appears the impact is limited to the vulnerable device itself.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description says "allows an attacker to cause network attack," which is vague but implies some impact. Since the attacker has admin access, they could potentially access sensitive information. However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure. Given the admin access, a Low impact on confidentiality is reasonable.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  With admin access, the attacker can likely modify settings or data, so there is at least a Low impact on integrity.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description says "allows an attacker to cause network attack," which could imply denial of service or disruption. Given admin access, the attacker could disrupt availability. So, Low impact on availability is reasonable.  
  **A = Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack possible remotely |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, just default creds |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (default admin) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Possible limited confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Possible limited integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Possible limited availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(6.06) = 6.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####235#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
Dell Command | Monitor, versions prior to 10.9, contain an arbitrary folder deletion vulnerability. A locally authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability in order to perform a privileged arbitrary file delete.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must be "locally authenticated," meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to be locally authenticated. Usually, local exploits with no special conditions are Low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "locally authenticated" and described as a "malicious user." The vulnerability allows "privileged arbitrary file delete," implying the attacker has some privileges but not necessarily high privileges. Since the attacker is a user with some privileges but not necessarily admin/root, this suggests Low privileges required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required by another user. The attacker is the local user exploiting the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows deletion of arbitrary folders/files with elevated privileges. The description says "privileged arbitrary file delete," which suggests the impact crosses privilege boundaries or affects resources beyond the attacker's own scope. This implies the scope is Changed (C).  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability is about arbitrary folder deletion, which affects availability and integrity, but no mention of data disclosure.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary file/folder deletion impacts integrity of the system. Since the attacker can delete files/folders with elevated privileges, this is a High impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Deleting arbitrary folders can cause denial of service or loss of availability of resources. This is likely High impact on availability.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker required |

| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (locally authenticated user) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Privilege escalation / impact beyond scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Arbitrary file/folder deletion impacts integrity highly |
| A      | H     | Arbitrary deletion impacts availability highly |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.87

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 7.52 * 0.8064 ≈ 6.06

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = round_up (min (1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up (min (1.08 * (6.06 + 1.87), 10))  
= round_up (min (1.08 * 7.93, 10))  
= round_up (8.56) = 8.6

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H

#####236#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection via manipulation of the argument `adminremark` in `admin/query-details.php`.
- Affects: PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 1.0.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Severity: Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- SQL Injection typically can be exploited remotely over the network if the vulnerable parameter is accessible via a web interface.  
- Since the vulnerable argument is `adminremark` in a web admin page, it is likely accessible over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the injection point is straightforward and no special conditions are needed.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerable parameter is `adminremark` in `admin/query-details.php`. The path suggests it is an admin page, which may require authentication.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say if authentication is required or if the vulnerability is exploitable without privileges.  
- Since it is an admin page, it is reasonable to assume some privileges are required (Low or High).  
- Is it Low or High?  
  - If the attacker needs to be an admin, then High.  
  - If any authenticated user can exploit, then Low.  
- Given the name "admin/query-details.php," it is likely that admin privileges are required.  
- **PR = High (H)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- SQL Injection typically does not require user interaction beyond the attacker sending crafted requests.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection usually affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since it is classified as critical and the injection is in an admin page, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Likely high impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but this is less common or less impactful than C and I.  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- Assume none.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via web interface |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward injection |
| PR     | H     | Admin page likely requires high privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | H     | SQLi can disclose sensitive data |
| I      | H     | SQLi can modify data |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [since Scope=Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(6.41) = 6.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####237#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in pgjdbc (PostgreSQL JDBC Driver).
- Allows attacker to inject SQL if using `PreferQueryMode=SIMPLE` (not the default).
- By crafting a specific payload, attacker can perform SQL Injection.
- Affects versions before certain releases.
- The vulnerability allows bypassing protections of parameterized queries.
- No mention of requiring authentication or user interaction.
- The attack is on a database driver, likely remotely exploitable via network.
- The impact is on confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to SQL Injection.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a JDBC driver, which is used over the network to connect to PostgreSQL.  
- The attacker can inject SQL remotely by sending crafted queries.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must set `PreferQueryMode=SIMPLE` (not default).  
- The attacker must construct a matching string payload to exploit.  
- This requires some specific conditions and knowledge, but no advanced or time-consuming steps are mentioned.  
- The complexity is somewhat higher than trivial but not very high.  
- Given the need to set a non-default mode and craft a payload, **Low (L)** is appropriate (since the conditions are clear and no special environment or timing is required).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- The attacker can inject SQL by sending queries with the driver configured in a certain way.  
- Likely no privileges required on the database.  
- **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted queries directly.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows SQL Injection, which can alter queries and potentially affect the database beyond the immediate component.  
- However, the vulnerability is in the driver, and the impact is on the database it connects to.  
- The driver is a client-side component, but the impact is on the database server.  
- This suggests the scope is **Changed (C)** because the vulnerability in the driver affects the database server's security properties.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data leakage.  
- The attacker can alter queries, potentially reading sensitive data.  
- Impact on confidentiality is **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection allows altering queries, modifying data.  
- Impact on integrity is **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can be used to cause denial of service or disrupt database availability.  
- Impact on availability is at least **Low (L)**, possibly High if the injection can cause crashes or resource exhaustion.  
- Since the description does not specify DoS, but SQL Injection often can cause some availability impact, **Low (L)** is a reasonable choice.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
  = 1 - 0.151 = 0.849

- Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.849 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.849 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.82 - 3.25 * (0.829)^15  
  = 6.17 - 3.25 * 0.087  
  = 6.17 - 0.28 = 5.89

- Base Score = 1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)  
  = 1.08 * (5.89 + 3.91)  
  = 1.08 * 9.8 = 10.58 → capped at 10.0

**Final Base Score: 10.0 (Critical)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.476  
≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.91 + 1.41)  
= Round_up (5.32)  
= 5.3 (Medium severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in PickPlugins Related Post allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Related Post: from n/a through 2.0.53.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Affected component:** Web plugin (Related Post)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed in the context of users visiting the affected web pages.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable remotely via the web (network).  
- The attacker sends crafted input over the network (HTTP request).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.  
- No complex conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system to exploit stored XSS.  
- Anyone who can submit input (usually unauthenticated users) can exploit.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For XSS, the victim user must visit the page containing the malicious script for the payload to execute.  
- This requires user interaction (the victim must load the page).  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- Stored XSS affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 4: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.35

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(2.35 + 2.68) = Roundup(5.03) = 5.0

#####240#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `link_to` parameter.
- Affected software: Elementor Addon Elements plugin for WordPress, versions ≤ 1.12.11.
- Attack vector: Injection of scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attacker with contributor access or higher.
- Impact: Execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of users who view the injected page.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed by submitting crafted input to the plugin (likely via HTTP request).
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.
- The attacker is authenticated but can perform the attack remotely over the network.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
- No special conditions or environment required.
- The attacker only needs to supply crafted input.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor access or higher.
- Contributor is a role with some privileges but not admin.
- According to CVSS v3.1, contributor access is considered Low privileges.
- Therefore, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires a victim user to access the injected page for the script to execute.
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (WordPress plugin).
- The impact is on the plugin and the user’s browser context.
- The vulnerability does not escalate privileges or affect other components beyond the plugin.
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.
- Typically, stored XSS is rated as Low impact on confidentiality.
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- This is a modification of integrity of the user’s interaction.
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.
- Therefore, A = None (N).

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Attacker must have contributor or higher access (low privileges).                         |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must view the injected page for script execution.                                  |

| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible disclosure of sensitive info via script execution.                               |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Injection of scripts modifies user interaction (integrity).                               |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability mentioned.                                                     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

Exploitability ≈ 2.07

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Round_up (4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

  The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request over the network (e.g., HTTP request). No physical or local access is required.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to send a crafted request; no special conditions or timing are required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Impact Sub-Score (ISC):**  
ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 1 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact:**  
Impact = 6.42 * ISC  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

**Exploitability:**  
Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5563  
= 8.22 * 0.4729  
= approx 3.88

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.4752)

#####243#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In netdagent, there is a possible information disclosure due to an incorrect bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description mentions "local escalation of privilege," implying the attacker must have local access.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; the vulnerability is due to an incorrect bounds check, which is typically straightforward to exploit.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which means the attacker must already have high privileges to exploit this.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to escalation of privilege locally, but does not indicate that the impact crosses security boundaries beyond the vulnerable component. The scope remains unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  There is "possible information disclosure," so confidentiality is impacted but not fully compromised.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description mentions "escalation of privilege," which implies the attacker can modify or execute with higher privileges, impacting integrity. However, since it is an escalation rather than full control, this is likely Low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####244#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack or, possibly, obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a crafted network request."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via a "crafted network request," so the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; the attacker just sends a crafted request. This implies low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "unauthenticated," meaning no privileges are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted request directly; no user interaction is needed.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows remote code execution or DoS, which typically affects the vulnerable component itself. No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from one component to another).  
  So, **Scope = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description mentions possible Remote Code Execution, which can lead to full system compromise, including confidentiality impact.  
  So, **Confidentiality = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Remote Code Execution implies the attacker can modify data or code, so integrity is highly impacted.  
  **Integrity = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The attacker can perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which impacts availability.  
  **Availability = High (H)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 4.37, 10))  
= round_up(10.24) → 10.0 (max score is 10)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue in the imlib_free_image_and_decache function of imlib2 v1.9.1 allows attackers to cause a heap buffer overflow via parsing a crafted image."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a crafted image. Typically, images are loaded locally or remotely. Since the description does not specify remote exploitation (e.g., over the network), but "parsing a crafted image" often implies local file processing. However, if the image can be supplied remotely (e.g., via a network service), AV would be Network.  
  Given no explicit mention of network service, assume **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow triggered by parsing a crafted image. Usually, such vulnerabilities have low complexity if the crafted image is straightforward. No mention of special conditions or timing.  
  Assume **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attacker needs to supply a crafted image to the function, which is likely part of an application running with the user's privileges, no elevated privileges are needed.  
  Assume **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker must get the victim to parse the crafted image, which implies user interaction (e.g., opening the image).  
  Assume **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a heap buffer overflow in the same component (imlib2). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  Assume **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap buffer overflow can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
  Assume **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap buffer overflow can lead to code execution or data corruption. This affects integrity.  
  Assume **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  Assume **High (H)**.

|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local file parsing of crafted image            |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed to supply crafted image   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must open/parse the crafted image          |

| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No explicit info disclosure                      |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Heap overflow can corrupt data or code          |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Can cause crashes or denial of service           |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 6.42 * 0.8064  
≈ 5.18

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(7.01)  
= 7.0

Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1 contains a stack overflow via the iptv.city.vlan parameter in the function formGetIptv.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered via a parameter (`iptv.city.vlan`), likely through a network interface (e.g., web interface or network service). Stack overflows in router firmware parameters are typically exploitable remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Stack overflow vulnerabilities usually require sending a specially crafted input but do not require complex conditions or timing. Unless specified otherwise, assume low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered via a parameter, likely accessible without authentication (common for router web interfaces or network services). Since no mention of authentication is made, assume no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the crafted input directly to the vulnerable parameter. No user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Stack overflow in a router firmware function likely affects the same security scope (the device itself). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stack overflow can lead to code execution or crash. Confidentiality impact is likely high if attacker can execute arbitrary code or read memory. Since it's a stack overflow, assume high confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Stack overflow can allow arbitrary code execution, modifying system behavior or data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Stack overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No complex conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact within same scope |
| C      | H     | Potential full data disclosure |
| I      | H     | Potential full data modification |
| A      | H     | Potential denial of service |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.76) = 9.8

#####247#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the FST fstReaderIterBlocks2 vesc allocation functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115, when compiled as a 32-bit binary. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to memory corruption. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted file. The attacker must deliver a malicious file to the victim, who then opens it locally. There is no indication that the attack can be performed remotely over a network or adjacent network.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted file that triggers an integer overflow. There is no indication of any special conditions or timing requirements. Usually, crafting a malicious file is straightforward for an attacker with knowledge of the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The victim needs to open the malicious file. There is no indication that the victim needs to have any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability. The user can be a normal user.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. This requires user interaction.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes memory corruption within the application (GTKWave). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes the scope to other components.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Memory corruption can potentially lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage or confidentiality impact. Given the memory corruption, a low confidentiality impact is reasonable.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Memory corruption can lead to modification of data or code execution, so there is at least a low integrity impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service. So there is at least a low availability impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 * 0.526  
≈ 3.38

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.21)  
= 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####248#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
KiTTY versions 0.76.1.13 and before is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow via the hostname, occurs due to insufficient bounds checking and input sanitization. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, which leads to arbitrary code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered via the hostname input. Hostname input is typically provided over a network connection (e.g., SSH client connecting to a server). Since the attacker can exploit this remotely by sending a crafted hostname, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking. No special conditions or timing are mentioned, so the attack complexity is **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs to provide a crafted hostname to trigger the overflow. No mention of needing any privileges on the system. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the malicious hostname to the vulnerable application. No user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution by overwriting adjacent memory. Since the vulnerability is in the application itself and the impact is on the same security scope (no indication that privileges or control extend beyond the vulnerable component), the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full compromise of confidentiality. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows full control over integrity. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can also disrupt availability. So, **High (H)**.

#####249#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is in the **jwx Go module**.
- The issue occurs when calling `jws.Parse` with a specially crafted JSON payload.
- The vulnerability leads to a **nil pointer dereference**, causing a **crash/Denial of Service (DoS)**.
- The attack vector involves sending a JSON payload to the system performing JWS verification.
- The vulnerability is patched in later versions.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling a function with a JSON payload.  
- This implies the attacker can send data over a network or at least adjacent network.  
- Since this is a Go module likely used in networked applications, and the payload is JSON serialized, it is reasonable to assume the attack can be performed remotely over a network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires crafting a JSON payload with a `signature` field present and `protected` field absent.  
- This is a specific condition but not particularly complex for an attacker who understands the protocol.  
- No indication of timing or environmental conditions.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to send a JSON payload to the vulnerable function.  
- No indication that any privileges are required.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack involves sending a payload to the system performing JWS verification.  
- No mention of requiring a user to perform any action (like clicking a link).  
- The system processes the payload automatically.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash/DoS in the system performing JWS verification.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The impact is limited to the vulnerable component's availability.  
- **Scope = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash/DoS, no mention of data disclosure.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data can be modified or corrupted.  
- **I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash/DoS, impacting availability.  
- The impact is likely significant since it crashes the system performing verification.  
- **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack can be performed remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High impact on availability (crash/DoS) |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
≈ 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.5952 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (7.4852)  
= 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The Dokan WordPress plugin before 3.6.4 allows vendors to inject arbitrary JavaScript in product reviews, which may allow them to run stored XSS attacks against other users like site administrators.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited by submitting product reviews, which is done over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to submit a review with malicious JavaScript. No special conditions or environment needed.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a vendor (a user with some privileges to submit product reviews).  
- This is not "None" because anonymous users cannot exploit it, but it is likely "Low" because vendors are not administrators.  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires other users (e.g., site administrators) to view the malicious review to trigger the XSS.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows code execution in the context of other users (site administrators).  
- This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from administrators.  
- This is a High impact on confidentiality.  
- Therefore, C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of administrators.  
- This is a High impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability directly.  
- Therefore, A = None (N)

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: L (Low)  
- UI: R (Required)

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker uploads a specially crafted network configuration remotely.  
- The vulnerability is in the network configuration service, so the attack is performed over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must upload a specially crafted configuration, which implies some level of complexity but no indication that it is difficult or requires special conditions.  
- No mention of timing or environment constraints.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated to upload the configuration.  
- Authentication implies some privileges, but the exact level is not specified.  
- Since the attacker can upload configuration, likely at least low privileges.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of any user interaction required for the attack to succeed.  
- The attacker uploads the configuration and commands execute on startup.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows command injection executed with root privileges during device startup.  
- The attacker’s privileges escalate from low (authenticated user) to root (system-level).  
- This indicates a change in scope (from user privileges to system privileges).  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command injection with root privileges can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Command injection allows arbitrary commands to be executed, modifying system state.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Command injection at root level can disrupt or disable device functionality.  
- **Value:** High (H)

#####252#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The vulnerability is in Lif Auth Server, specifically in the `get_pfp` and `get_banner` routes.
- The issue is that there is no validation/check on the files requested via these URLs.
- This could allow an attacker to access files they shouldn't have access to.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.4.0.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The issue is with routes on the Auth Server, which implies the attacker can send requests over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description suggests no special conditions or environment requirements; the attacker just needs to send a crafted request.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can access files they shouldn't have access to via these routes.  
- The description does not mention needing any authentication or privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is exploiting a server route directly; no user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to files the attacker shouldn't have access to.  
- This suggests the impact crosses security boundaries within the system (e.g., from one component to another).  
- However, since the vulnerability is in the Auth Server and the impact is on files accessible by the same server, it is likely the scope is Unchanged (U).  
- If the vulnerability allowed impact beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., to other components or systems), Scope would be Changed (C).  
- Given the description, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can access unauthorized files, which is a confidentiality breach.  
- The description does not specify the sensitivity of the files, but unauthorized file access generally implies at least a Low impact.  
- Since the attacker can access files they shouldn't, but no indication of total data disclosure, set Confidentiality = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention modification of files or data.  
- Therefore, Integrity = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N).

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable over the network via server routes.                                            |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                            |

| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                              |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the vulnerable component (Auth Server).                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Unauthorized access to files implies confidentiality impact.                               |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact mentioned.                                                             |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact mentioned.                                                          |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (5.30)  
= 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cybozu KUNAI for Android 3.0.20 to 3.0.21 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by performing certain operations.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and unauthenticated, so the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to perform certain operations. Usually, DoS vulnerabilities that can be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker remotely are considered low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required. The attacker can cause DoS by performing operations directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The description does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. A DoS typically affects the same scope (the application or service itself).  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability causes DoS, no mention of data disclosure.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  DoS impacts availability. The description implies a denial-of-service condition, which is typically a high impact on availability.  
  **A = High (H)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (3.5952 + 3.88)  
= Roundup (7.4752)

#####254#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in the WordPress plugin "Awesome Support" up to version 6.1.7.  
- Missing capability check on the editor_html() function.  
- Allows unauthorized access to data (viewing password protected and draft posts).  
- Attackers must be authenticated with subscriber-level access or higher.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited by an authenticated user within WordPress.  
- WordPress is a web application accessed over the network.  
- However, the attacker must be authenticated, so the attack is not purely remote without any access.  
- Since the attacker must be logged in, but can be anywhere on the network, this is considered **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with subscriber-level access or above.  
- Subscriber is a low-level privilege in WordPress, but it is not "None".  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges are those that provide basic user capabilities but not administrative.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is authenticated and can directly exploit the vulnerability.  
- No indication that another user must perform any action.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to data within the same component (WordPress plugin).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can view password protected and draft posts, which are normally restricted.  
- This is unauthorized disclosure of information.  
- The impact is more than none but probably not total system-wide data disclosure.  
- This is best rated as **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the attacker can modify data.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the attacker can affect availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Unchanged)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(4.09)  
= 4.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

- User interaction: Not mentioned, likely none (attacker or user triggers the vulnerability by accessing the system)  
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but information disclosure within the same security scope (no indication of privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component)  

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a web portal manager, so the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No special conditions or complex steps mentioned. IDOR vulnerabilities are typically straightforward to exploit.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with these values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00

#####256#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Input Validation in Hitron Systems DVR HVR-4781 1.03~4.02 allows an attacker to cause network attack in case of using default admin ID/PW."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Improper Input Validation**: This suggests some form of input is not properly checked, potentially leading to exploitation.
- **Allows an attacker to cause network attack**: The attacker can perform the attack remotely over the network.
- **In case of using default admin ID/PW**: The attacker must authenticate using default credentials.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**  
   The attack can be performed over the network.  
   **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**  
   The attacker needs to use default admin credentials, which is a known weakness but requires the system to be in a default state. This is not a complex attack but requires a specific condition (default credentials).  
   According to CVSS guidelines, requiring default credentials is usually considered **Low (L)** complexity because the attacker does not need special conditions beyond default credentials.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**  
   The attacker must authenticate with default admin credentials. Admin credentials imply **High** privileges. However, CVSS defines privileges as:  
   - None (N): No privileges required  
   - Low (L): Basic user privileges  
   - High (H): Administrative privileges  
   
   Since the attacker must use admin credentials, this is **High (H)**.  
   **Value:** High (H)

4. **User Interaction (UI)**  
   The description does not mention any user interaction required for the attack. The attacker uses default credentials to log in and exploit the vulnerability.  
   **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S)**  
   The vulnerability allows a network attack, but does it affect resources beyond the vulnerable component? The description does not specify that the scope changes (e.g., from one component to another).  
   Assume **Unchanged (U)**.  
   **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C)**  
   The description says "allows an attacker to cause network attack," but does not specify data disclosure. Improper input validation with admin access could lead to data compromise, but since it's not explicitly stated, we assume **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

7. **Integrity (I)**  
   With admin access and improper input validation, the attacker could modify data or system settings. This suggests a **High (H)** impact on integrity.  
   **Value:** High (H)

8. **Availability (A)**  
   The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact. Assume **None (N)**.  
   **Value:** None (N)

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack can be performed over the network                                                  |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(5.45)  
= 5.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in Project Worlds Online Time Table Generator 1.0
- Affected file: course_ajax.php (unknown part)
- Attack vector: Remote (possible to initiate the attack remotely)
- Impact: Critical (implies high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability)
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- Attack complexity: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection typically requires low complexity
- Privileges required: Not mentioned, likely none since it is remotely exploitable via argument manipulation
- User interaction: Not mentioned, likely none (attacker can send crafted request)
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection usually affects the same security scope (database/application)
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability: SQL injection typically allows data disclosure (confidentiality), data modification (integrity), and possibly denial of service (availability)

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  Reason: "It is possible to initiate the attack remotely" means the attacker can exploit over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: SQL injection is generally straightforward once the vulnerability is known; no special conditions required.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  Reason: No mention of needing any privileges; attacker can exploit by manipulating an argument remotely.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  Reason: No mention of user interaction; attacker can send the malicious request directly.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  Reason: SQL injection affects the same component (database/application) without affecting other components or privileges.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  Reason: SQL injection can lead to full disclosure of sensitive data.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  Reason: SQL injection can allow modification of data.

- **Availability (A):** Low (L)  
  Reason: SQL injection can sometimes cause denial of service, but usually availability impact is less than confidentiality/integrity.

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity SQL injection |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

---

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for confirmation)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

Calculating Impact:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 1 - [0.1509]  
= 0.8491

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.477  
= 3.92

Base Score (Scope Unchanged):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(0.8491*6.42 + 3.92, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.92, 10))  
= round_up(9.37)  
= 9.4 (Critical)

This matches the "critical" classification in the description.

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####259#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected product: Leap13 Premium Addons for Elementor (up to version 4.10.16)
- Impact: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation allows stored XSS.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Stored XSS typically can be exploited remotely by sending crafted input that is stored and later rendered in a web page. The attacker does not need local access.  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond submitting crafted input. No complex conditions or timing required.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker usually does not need any privileges to inject the malicious script; they just need to submit input (e.g., via a form).  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
For XSS, the victim must interact with the malicious content (e.g., visit the page containing the stored script).  
- UI: Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application). The vulnerability does not affect other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser. This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality (not full system compromise).  
- C: Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially modifying data or performing unauthorized actions. This is usually considered a **Low** impact on integrity.  
- I: Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A: None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must view malicious content |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact (data theft) |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact (actions on behalf of user) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.33) = 5.3

#####260#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In Modem IMS SMS UA, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to remote denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in "Modem IMS SMS UA" and can be exploited remotely. Since it involves SMS (telephony), the attacker can send data over the network (cellular network). This is considered **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check, which is straightforward to exploit. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  "No additional execution privileges needed" means the attacker does not need any privileges. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation." So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) in the modem component. The description does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes the security scope. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The impact is denial of service, no mention of data disclosure. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability can cause denial of service, which impacts availability. The description does not specify the severity of DoS (partial or complete). Usually, an out-of-bounds write causing DoS is considered **High (H)** impact on availability.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote exploitation over network (SMS)         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploitation                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction needed                      |
| Scope (S)            | U      | No scope change                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                       |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                             |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Denial of service impact                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.99

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56)] = 1 - (1 * 1 * 0.44) = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 3.99, 10)) = round_up(7.59) = 7.6 → 7.6 rounds to 7.6 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####261#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Sulu CMS (PHP, Symfony-based)
- Vulnerability: Inputting HTML into the Tag name leads to execution of HTML when the tag name is listed in the autocomplete form.
- Only admin users can create tags, so only admin users can trigger the vulnerability.
- The issue is patched in versions 2.4.16 and 2.5.12.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability is triggered when the tag name is listed in the autocomplete form. The attacker must input HTML into the tag name. Since only admin users can create tags, the attacker must have admin access to the system. The attack involves inputting data that is later executed in the autocomplete form, presumably accessed over the network (e.g., via a web interface).  
- The attacker must be an admin user (privileges required), but the attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- The attack vector is **Network (N)** because the attacker interacts with the system over the network (web interface).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Is the attack straightforward or does it require special conditions?  
- The attacker must be an admin user (which is a high bar), but the actual exploitation (inputting HTML into the tag name) is straightforward once admin access is obtained.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond admin access.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Only admin users can create tags.  
- Admin users typically have high privileges.  
- So, **High (H)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered when the tag name is listed in the autocomplete form.  
- The description does not mention that another user must interact to trigger the vulnerability.  
- However, the execution happens when the tag name is listed in the autocomplete form, which implies that a user (possibly the admin or another user) must view or interact with the autocomplete form for the HTML to execute.  
- Since the attacker is an admin user who creates the tag, but the execution happens when the tag name is listed (likely by another user), user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be triggered.  
- Therefore, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component?  
- The vulnerability is an XSS-like issue where HTML is executed in the context of the web application.  
- The attacker is an admin user, and the impact is on the same component (the CMS).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or privileges beyond the original scope.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of HTML in the autocomplete form.  
- This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., session tokens, user data) if exploited.  
- Since the attacker is an admin user, the impact on confidentiality is limited to what the admin can already access.  
- However, if the vulnerability can be triggered by other users viewing the autocomplete, it could expose admin data to them.  
- The description is not explicit about data disclosure, but HTML execution can lead to data theft.  
- Given the potential for data exposure, assign **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of HTML, which could be used to modify displayed content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- However, the description does not mention direct modification of data or system files.  
- The impact on integrity is likely limited to low (e.g., modifying displayed content).  
- So, **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or impact on availability.  
- So, **None (N)** availability impact.

6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.27 = 1.452  
1.452 × 0.62 = 0.900

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 0.900)  
= Round_up (3.415)  
= 3.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

  The vulnerability is a web application XSS, exploitable remotely over the network (via HTTP requests).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require low complexity to exploit if the input is directly reflected without additional conditions. The description says "unsafe echo," implying straightforward exploitation.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit an XSS vulnerability in a public-facing web app.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the victim (user) must interact by visiting a malicious link or page to trigger the script.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). It does not affect other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33)  
= 5.3 (Medium severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Multiple TP-LINK products are vulnerable.  
- The attacker is network-adjacent (not remote over the internet, but on the same network segment).  
- The attacker is unauthenticated (no privileges required).  
- The attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands (indicating a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability).  

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The attacker is network-adjacent, meaning the attacker must be on the same local network or broadcast domain.  
   - **Value:** Adjacent (A)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs network adjacency and no authentication.  
   - This suggests the attack complexity is low.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - The description does not mention any user interaction required. The attacker can execute commands directly.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The attacker executes arbitrary OS commands on the device, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., the OS).  
   - This indicates a change in scope.  
   - **Value:** Changed (C)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - Arbitrary OS command execution can lead to full disclosure of information.  
   - High impact on confidentiality.  
   - **Value:** High (H)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - Arbitrary OS command execution allows modification of data and system state.  
   - High impact on integrity.

**Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed) =**  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in DeDeCMS up to 5.7.112.
- Affected component: Backend, file_class.php.
- Vulnerability type: unrestricted upload (likely arbitrary file upload).
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- No vendor response.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Unrestricted upload suggests low complexity.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.  
- Unrestricted upload usually means no privileges required.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention the need for user interaction.  
- Typically, unrestricted upload vulnerabilities exploited remotely do not require user interaction.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the backend component, and the attack leads to unrestricted upload.  
- Uploading files can lead to code execution or other impacts beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Usually, unrestricted upload leads to a change in scope because it affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:C (Changed)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unrestricted upload itself does not directly disclose information.  
- However, if the uploaded file can be used to execute code or access data, confidentiality can be impacted.  
- Since the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but unrestricted upload often leads to high confidentiality impact (e.g., remote code execution), we assume **High**.  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload can allow an attacker to modify or add files, which impacts integrity.  
- This is typically a high impact.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Unrestricted upload can be used to disrupt service (e.g., uploading malicious scripts, web shells).  
- This can lead to high availability impact.  
- **A:H (High)**

= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, then 0, else:  
If Scope Changed:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in DeShang DSKMS up to 3.1.2.
- Affects processing of the file public/install.php.
- Leads to improper access controls.
- Attack may be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack may be initiated remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- The attack seems straightforward (improper access control).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- "Improper access controls" usually means the attacker does not need prior privileges.  
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely without user help.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects access controls in the same component (public/install.php).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- "Improper access controls" implies unauthorized access to data.  
- The description is vague but "problematic" and "improper access controls" usually imply some data disclosure.  
- Since the impact is not described as total data loss, assume **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Improper access controls can allow modification of data.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data modification, but improper access controls often allow at least some integrity impact.  
- Assume **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack can be initiated remotely over the network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions or complexity mentioned |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to exploit |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable component |

| I      | L     | Possible modification due to improper access controls |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.40)  
= 6.4 → 6.4 rounds up to 6.4 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

#####266#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
The EventON WordPress plugin before versions 4.5.5 and 2.2.7 does not sanitize and escape some settings, allowing high privilege users (e.g., admin) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (such as in multisite setups).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by a high privilege user (admin) within the WordPress environment.  
- The attacker must have access to the plugin settings, which implies local access to the WordPress admin interface.  
- This is not a remote network attack, but rather local or adjacent.  
- Since the attacker must be logged in and interact with the plugin settings, this is considered **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)**.  
- Usually, attacks requiring admin access to a web application are considered **Adjacent (A)** because the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the application interface.  
- However, WordPress admin access is typically considered local because the attacker must be authenticated and have admin privileges.  
- According to CVSS guidelines, if the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the application, the vector is **Adjacent (A)** if the attacker is on the same network or **Local (L)** if the attacker must have local system access.  
- Since this is a web application attack requiring admin login, the vector is **Adjacent (A)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to lack of sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once the attacker has access.  
- No special conditions or timing are required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a high privilege user such as admin.  
- This means **High (H)** privileges are required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the admin user performing the attack themselves (stored XSS).  
- No other user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stored XSS, which can affect other users who view the stored data.  
- This means the impact crosses from the vulnerable component (plugin) to other components (other users' browsers).  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reason                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | A     | Requires admin access to WordPress admin interface (adjacent network).                  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Exploit is straightforward once access is obtained.                                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| H   | High privilege (admin) required.                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required beyond attacker.                                          |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact affects other users (crosses scope).                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible disclosure of sensitive info via XSS.                                         |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible modification of content or actions via XSS.                                   |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability.                                                             |

- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Calculations:**

  ≈ 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.1767  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.1096  
  ≈ 0.9

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - 0.6084]  
  = 7.52 × 0.3916  
  ≈ 2.95

- Base Score (Scope Changed):  
  = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves creating webhooks remotely (likely over the network).  
- Since users can create webhooks remotely, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is due to a failure to check security levels or user limits.  
- No special conditions or timing required; the attacker just needs to create a webhook.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a registered Jira user to create webhooks.  
- Registered user implies some privileges, but not admin or high privileges.  
- This corresponds to **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the one creating the webhook; no other user interaction is needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to all Jira issues, which is beyond the privileges of the user creating the webhook.  
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries (from limited user access to all issues).  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker gains access to all Jira issues, which likely contain sensitive information.  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention modification of data, only unauthorized access.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of disruption or denial of service.  
- So, **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote creation of webhooks over network                                                   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Registered user privileges required                                                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | Attacker acts alone                                                                        |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact crosses security boundaries                                                         |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Full access to all Jira issues                                                             |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No modification mentioned                                                                  |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact mentioned                                                           |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.68

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

- Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 × (Impact Subscore - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact Subscore - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.56 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.56 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.531 - 3.25 × (0.54)^15  
= 3.99 - 3.25 × very small number (~0)  
≈ 3.99

- Base Score = Round up to one decimal place the minimum of (Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 3.99 + 2.68 = 6.67 → 6.7

#####268#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Jenkins versions 2.217 through 2.441 and LTS 2.222.1 through 2.426.2 do not perform origin validation on requests made through the CLI WebSocket endpoint.
- This results in a cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability.
- Attackers can execute CLI commands on the Jenkins controller.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed through the CLI WebSocket endpoint, which is accessible over the network.  
- Since the attack can be performed remotely over the network, AV = **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to missing origin validation, which is a straightforward flaw.  
- The attacker only needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious page to exploit it (CSWSH).  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can execute CLI commands on the Jenkins controller by hijacking the WebSocket connection.  
- The description implies the attacker does not need prior privileges on the Jenkins server; the attack is cross-site and exploits the victim's browser session.  
- PR = **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is a cross-site WebSocket hijacking, which requires the victim to visit a malicious website or click a link.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
- UI = **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of commands on the Jenkins controller itself.  
- The impact is on the same security authority (the Jenkins controller).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- S = **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can execute CLI commands, which likely allows reading sensitive information.  
- This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
- C = **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute commands, which can modify or delete data.  
- High impact on integrity.  
- I = **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Executing commands can disrupt service or delete files, causing denial of service.  
- High impact on availability.  
- A = **High (H)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U),  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(8.13)  
= 8.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####269#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The authentication cookies are generated using an algorithm based on the username, hardcoded secret and the up-time, and can be guessed in a reasonable time."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability involves authentication cookies that can be guessed.
- This implies an attacker can predict or forge authentication cookies.
- The attack likely allows unauthorized access or impersonation.
- The description suggests the attack can be done remotely (since cookies are used in web contexts).
- The attack complexity is probably low because the cookies can be guessed "in a reasonable time."
- No mention of user interaction.
- Privileges required: likely none, since guessing cookies is usually done without prior privileges.
- Scope: likely unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (authentication cookies).
- Impact: guessing cookies can lead to unauthorized access, so confidentiality, integrity, and availability could be impacted to some degree.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Cookies are used in web applications, so the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The cookies can be guessed "in a reasonable time," implying low complexity.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges to guess the cookies.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No user interaction is required for guessing cookies.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects authentication cookies, which are part of the same security scope (no privilege escalation to other components).  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Guessing authentication cookies can lead to unauthorized access to user data, so confidentiality is impacted.  
- The impact is likely high because the attacker can impersonate a user.  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can impersonate a user, potentially modifying data as that user.  
- Integrity is also highly impacted.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936  
= 0.8064

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.8064  
= 5.18

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.07)  
= 9.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

---

### Final summary:

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)

#####270#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability type: Cross-site scripting (XSS)  
- Affected product: Trend Micro Apex Central  
- Impact: Remote attacker can execute arbitrary code  
- Exploitation requires user interaction (target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file)  

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability over a network (e.g., via a malicious webpage).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond user interaction.  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if the attacker just needs to lure the user to a malicious page.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description explicitly states user interaction is required (target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file).  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code on the affected installation.  
- Since the vulnerability is within the same security scope (no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component), the scope is likely Unchanged.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can lead to full compromise, including confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality impact is High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can disrupt availability (e.g., by crashing the system or deleting files).  
- Therefore, Availability impact is High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(8.7) = 8.7

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **8.7** (High severity).

#####271#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `concat` built-in function of Vyper, a smart contract language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
- The overflow can overwrite valid data in memory.
- The issue is internal to the smart contract language implementation.
- No vulnerable contracts were found in production.
- The overflow is length-dependent and might go unnoticed during testing.
- The vulnerability affects internal functions and memory close to return statements.
- The issue has been fixed in a future release.
- Users are advised to update.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in a programming language's built-in function.
- Exploitation requires the attacker to write or deploy a smart contract using the vulnerable `concat` function.
- The attack is not remotely exploitable over a network directly.
- The attacker must have local access to deploy or write contracts.
- In Ethereum, deploying or interacting with contracts is done over the network, but the vulnerability is in the contract code itself, not in a network service.
- However, since the vulnerability is in the contract code, and contracts are deployed and executed on the Ethereum network, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by submitting transactions.

**Conclusion:** The attack vector is **Network (N)** because the attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by submitting transactions to the Ethereum network.

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The overflow is length-dependent and might go unnoticed during testing.
- Not all usages of `concat` will cause the overflow.
- The attacker needs to craft specific contract code or inputs to trigger the overflow.
- This suggests some conditions must be met, but no special environment or timing conditions are required.

**Conclusion:** The attack complexity is **Low (L)** because the attacker can trigger the overflow with crafted input, no special conditions required.

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be able to deploy or interact with contracts using the vulnerable `concat` function.
- In Ethereum, anyone can deploy contracts or send transactions.
- No special privileges are required.

**Conclusion:** Privileges Required is **None (N)**.

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker triggers the vulnerability by submitting transactions or deploying contracts.
- No other user interaction is required.

**Conclusion:** User Interaction is **None (N)**.

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability causes a buffer overflow that can change the semantics of the contract.
- The impact is within the same security scope (the contract execution environment).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable contract or the Ethereum Virtual Machine itself.

**Conclusion:** Scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The overflow can overwrite valid data.
- No explicit mention of data disclosure.
- The impact is on contract semantics, not on leaking confidential information.

**Conclusion:** Confidentiality impact is **None (N)**.

---

**Integrity (I):**

- The overflow can change the semantics of the contract.
- This implies the attacker can alter the behavior or data of the contract.

**Conclusion:** Integrity impact is **High (H)**.

---

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- The vulnerability affects contract behavior but not availability.

**Conclusion:** Availability impact is **None (N)**.

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the vulnerable contract              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No data disclosure                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Contract semantics can be changed                      |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556

= 8.22 * 0.472

= approx 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]

= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]

= 1 - [1 * 0.44 * 1] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact

= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.88, 10)) = round_up(7.4752) = 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Missing Authorization vulnerability in SedLex Traffic Manager. This issue affects Traffic Manager: from n/a through 1.4.5."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Missing Authorization  
  This typically means that the system does not properly check if a user is authorized to perform an action.

- **Affected product:** SedLex Traffic Manager up to version 1.4.5

- **Impact:** Because authorization is missing, an attacker might be able to perform actions they should not be allowed to.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since this is a Traffic Manager (likely a network service), and the vulnerability is missing authorization, it is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Missing authorization usually means no special conditions or complex steps are required to exploit.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Missing authorization means the attacker can perform actions without proper privileges.  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges to exploit.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Missing authorization typically does not require user interaction; the attacker can send requests directly.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (Traffic Manager) and does not indicate that it affects other components or security domains.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Missing authorization can allow unauthorized access to data.  
- The description does not specify data disclosure, but missing authorization often leads to at least some data exposure.  
- Assign **Low (L)** as a conservative estimate.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Missing authorization can allow unauthorized modification of data or settings.  
- Assign **Low (L)** as a conservative estimate.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- Assign **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible service |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions needed |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible unauthorized data access |
| I      | L     | Possible unauthorized data modification |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(6.39) = 6.4

- Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- SQL Injection typically occurs over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities usually require low complexity if no additional conditions are needed.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web application admin file (/admin/action/add_con.php), but the description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Since the attack can be launched remotely and no mention of authentication is made, assume no privileges required.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- SQL Injection attacks typically do not require user interaction; the attacker sends crafted requests directly.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the web application itself, and the impact is on the same component (SQL Injection affecting the database behind the web app).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since the vulnerability is classified as critical and SQL Injection is often capable of reading sensitive data, assume High impact on confidentiality.  
- Therefore, C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Typically, SQL Injection can lead to data modification or deletion.  
- Therefore, Integrity impact is High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can also lead to denial of service (e.g., by deleting data or locking tables).  
- Given the critical classification, assume High impact on availability.  
- Therefore, Availability = High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
≈ 8.22 × 0.4726  
≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Impact Score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (5.88 + 3.88)  
= Round_up (9.76)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####274#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin that allows any logged-in user (including low-privilege roles like subscribers) to export blog data without proper authorization checks. This includes restricted and unpublished posts and passwords of protected posts.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by a logged-in user via the WordPress interface, which is typically accessed over the network (HTTP).  
- Since the attacker can exploit this remotely over the network, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to be logged in; no special conditions or complex steps are required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be logged in, but can be a subscriber (lowest privilege level).  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges correspond to roles with limited privileges but not none.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker performs the action themselves; no other user needs to interact.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to data within the same security scope (the WordPress application).  
- No impact on other components or security domains.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can access restricted and unpublished posts and passwords of protected posts.  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.  
- C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability description does not mention modification of data, only export (read access).  
- I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No impact on availability is described.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network access via HTTP |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Requires logged-in user with low privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | H     | Access to restricted content and passwords |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

#####275#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An SQL Injection vulnerability in the "Simple Inventory Management – just scan barcode to manage products and orders" plugin for WooCommerce. This vulnerability allows improper neutralization of special elements in SQL commands.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications are typically exploitable remotely over the network, as the attacker sends crafted input to the web application.  
- **AV:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the input is not sanitized properly and no additional conditions are needed. The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- **AC:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
Since this is a WooCommerce plugin vulnerability, and the description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges, it is likely exploitable without privileges.  
- **PR:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
SQL Injection typically does not require user interaction; the attacker sends crafted requests directly.  
- **UI:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
SQL Injection vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure. The impact is often high because attackers can extract sensitive data. However, since the description does not specify the extent, but SQLi generally leads to high confidentiality impact.  
- **C:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
SQL Injection can allow attackers to modify or delete data, so integrity impact is typically high.  
- **I:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
SQL Injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but this is less common or less severe than confidentiality and integrity impacts. Since the description does not mention availability impact, we assume none.  
- **A:** None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936  
= 0.8064

Impact = 6.42 × ISC_Base  
= 6.42 × 0.8064  
= 5.18

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (5.18 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (9.07)  
= 9.1

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(9.33) = 9.3

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(8.69) = 8.7

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **8.7** (High severity).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in cloudfavorites favorites-web 1.3.0, component Nickname Handler.
- Type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Impact: Manipulation leads to cross-site scripting.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS usually requires low complexity to exploit.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that attacker needs any privileges.  
- XSS is typically exploitable without any privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page).  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually considered Low impact on confidentiality because it depends on the context.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts, potentially modifying data or actions.  
- Usually considered Low impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required (victim must visit) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.52 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.20) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **5.2**.

  The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users remotely (likely over the web). Since WordPress plugins are typically accessed over the network, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attack is straightforward (no authorization or CSRF checks). So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is **unauthenticated**, so **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated and can perform actions directly. No mention of needing another user to interact. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows modification of posts and documents within the WordPress plugin. The impact is within the same security scope (the WordPress application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can delete and add documents/posts but no mention of reading confidential information. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can add and delete documents and posts, which modifies data. This is a **High (H)** impact on integrity.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Deleting arbitrary posts and documents can disrupt availability of content. This is a **High (H)** impact on availability.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 4.37, 10))  
= round_up(9.55) = 9.6 → 9.6 rounds to 9.6 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

**Final Base Score:** 9.6 (High severity)

#####282#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
The Ni Purchase Order (PO) For WooCommerce WordPress plugin (up to version 1.2.1) does not validate logo and signature image files uploaded in the settings. This allows a high privileged user to upload arbitrary files to the web server, leading to remote code execution (RCE) by uploading a web shell.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack requires uploading files through the plugin's settings interface. Since this is a WordPress plugin, the attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface or some authenticated interface to upload files. The attack is performed over the network (HTTP/HTTPS), but the attacker must be a user with high privileges.  
  Since the attacker interacts remotely over the network, **AV = Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is due to lack of validation on uploaded files. No special conditions or timing are required beyond having the necessary privileges. This suggests the attack complexity is low.  
  **AC = Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "allowing high privileged user to upload arbitrary files." So the attacker must have high privileges (e.g., admin or similar) to exploit this.  
  **PR = High (H)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is a high privileged user who uploads files themselves. No other user interaction is required.  
  **UI = None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to remote code execution on the web server. The plugin runs within the WordPress application, and the RCE affects the web server environment, which is outside the scope of the plugin itself. This means the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
  Therefore, **Scope = Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  RCE typically allows full control over the system, including reading sensitive data. So confidentiality impact is high.  
  **C = High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  RCE allows arbitrary code execution, so integrity is fully compromised.  
  **I = High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  RCE can lead to denial of service or other availability impacts.  
  **A = High (H)**.

| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Full confidentiality impact due to RCE                                                   |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Full integrity impact due to RCE                                                         |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Full availability impact due to RCE                                                      |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 when Scope is Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 1.22

2. Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

3. Impact = 7.52 × (Impact Subscore - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact Subscore - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.886 - 3.25 × (0.895)^15  
= 6.66 - 3.25 × 0.142  
= 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

4. Since Scope is Changed, Base Score = min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
= min(1.08 × (6.20 + 1.22), 10)  
= min(1.08 × 7.42, 10)  
= min(8.01, 10) = 8.0 (rounded to one decimal place)

- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(9.76)  
= 9.8

#####284#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
SWFTools 0.9.2 772e55a allows attackers to trigger a large memory-allocation attempt via a crafted document, as demonstrated by pdf2swf. This occurs in png_read_chunk in lib/png.c.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is triggered via a crafted document processed by pdf2swf.  
- The attacker must supply a crafted file, which is then processed locally by the vulnerable software.  
- This implies the attacker must have local access to the system or at least the ability to get the victim to open/process the crafted document.  
- Since the attack requires the victim to open a crafted file locally, the vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack involves triggering a large memory allocation via a crafted document.  
- No special conditions or timing are mentioned; the crafted document alone is sufficient.  
- This suggests **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply a crafted document to the vulnerable application.  
- No mention of needing any privileges on the system.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim to open or process the crafted document with pdf2swf.  
- This means user interaction is required.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a library function (png_read_chunk) used by pdf2swf.  
- The impact is on the same software component (memory allocation in the process).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or causes a change in scope.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention any data disclosure.  
- The issue is about triggering a large memory allocation, which may lead to a denial of service but not data leakage.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Triggering a large memory allocation can cause a denial of service (crash or resource exhaustion).  
- This impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system unavailability.  
- Given the description, **High (H)** is appropriate because large memory allocation attempts can crash the application or severely degrade availability.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local processing of crafted document                                             |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed                                                              |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                                                                       |

| Availability (A)     | H      | Large memory allocation can cause denial of service                                       |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.4252)  
= 5.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####285#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Qualys Jenkins Plugin for Policy Compliance (<= 1.0.5).
- Missing permission check during connectivity check to Qualys Cloud Services.
- Any user with login access and access to configure or edit jobs can exploit.
- Exploit allows configuring a rogue endpoint.
- This can lead to reflected/stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) via response data processing.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack requires the attacker to be a logged-in user with job configuration/edit access.
- The attack is performed through the Jenkins UI or plugin interface.
- The attacker is not remote without authentication; they must have login access.
- The attacker interacts with the system locally via the web interface.
- Since the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the system locally (via web UI), the vector is **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)**?

- **Network (N)** means attacker can exploit remotely over the network without authentication.
- **Adjacent (A)** means attacker must be on the same logical network or adjacent network.
- **Local (L)** means attacker must have local access to the system (e.g., shell or physical access).
- **Physical (P)** means physical access is required.

Here, the attacker must be logged in and have job configuration rights, which is a form of authenticated access via the web interface.

In CVSS v3.1, "Local" means physical or logical local access to the vulnerable component (e.g., shell access). "Adjacent" means the attacker is on the same shared physical or logical network.

Since the attacker is authenticated via the web interface, this is considered **Network (N)** because the attack is performed over the network (HTTP interface), but requires authentication.

However, CVSS v3.1 guidance states:

- If the attacker must be authenticated, but the attack is performed over the network, AV is still Network (N).

Therefore:

**AV = N (Network)**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must have login access and job configuration/edit rights.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- The attack is straightforward once the attacker has the required privileges.

Therefore:

**AC = Low (L)**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be logged in and have access to configure or edit jobs.
- This is a non-administrative but privileged user role.

In CVSS v3.1:

- PR:N = no privileges required
- PR:L = low privileges required
- PR:H = high privileges required

Since the attacker must have job configuration/edit rights (not just any user), this is **Low (L)** privileges.

**PR = L (Low)**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by configuring a rogue endpoint and injecting XSS payloads.
- No indication that another user must perform any action for the exploit to succeed.
- The attacker is the user with the required privileges.

Therefore:

**UI = None (N)**

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows the attacker to control response data processing within the Jenkins plugin.
- The impact is within the same security scope (Jenkins plugin).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.

Therefore:

**S = Unchanged (U)**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The vulnerability allows XSS, which can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- This implies some confidentiality impact.

XSS typically leads to **Low (L)** confidentiality impact because it can leak some information but not full system compromise.

**C = Low (L)**

---

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify or manipulate data in the context of the user.
- However, no direct indication of data modification or system file changes.
- XSS can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, which can be considered a low integrity impact.

**I = Low (L)**

---

**Availability (A):**

- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.
- XSS does not typically impact availability.

**A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via web interface requiring login |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | L     | Requires job configuration/edit privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond attacker |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | XSS can leak some information |
| I      | L     | XSS can affect integrity via script injection |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1-C)*(1-I)*(1-A)]**

= 1 - [(1-0.22)*(1-0.22)*(1-0)]

= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)

= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**

= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10)) = round_up(5.19) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place: **5.2**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in SVNLabs Softwares HTML5 SoundCloud Player with Playlist Free. This issue affects versions from n/a through 2.8.0.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and impact

- **Vulnerability type:** Deserialization of untrusted data  
- **Affected software:** HTML5 SoundCloud Player with Playlist Free  
- **Versions affected:** up to 2.8.0

Deserialization of untrusted data vulnerabilities typically allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service by sending crafted serialized objects.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since this is a web player (HTML5 SoundCloud Player), the attack can be launched remotely over the network (e.g., via crafted data sent to the player).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities usually require sending specially crafted data, but no special conditions or timing are needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Typically, deserialization vulnerabilities in web players can be exploited without any privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted data to the player; the user may need to load or interact with the malicious data.  
- Since it is a player, the user likely needs to open or load the malicious content for the exploit to trigger.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities often allow code execution or impact beyond the vulnerable component, potentially affecting the entire system or application.  
- However, since this is a plugin/player, the impact is likely confined to the same security scope (the player itself).  
- Without explicit info about privilege escalation or impact beyond the component, assume **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Deserialization can lead to arbitrary code execution or data exposure.  
- Likely to cause at least some data disclosure.  
- Assign **High (H)** to reflect potential full data compromise.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data.  
- Assign **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Assign **High (H)**.

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 ≈ 0.915

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score:**  
= Impact + Exploitability  
= 5.88 + 2.82 = 8.7

Rounded to one decimal place: **8.7**

#####288#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** in Icinga Director.
- It allows attackers to perform unauthorized changes in the monitoring environment **without the victim's awareness**.
- The attack requires the victim to be authenticated (implied, since changes are made "without the awareness of the victim").
- The attack is performed via web forms (likely over the network).
- No mention of privilege escalation or elevated privileges required beyond the victim's own privileges.
- No mention of user interaction beyond the victim being tricked into submitting a request (typical for CSRF).
- The impact is on the monitoring environment configuration, so it affects **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** to some extent.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely over the web (network).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks typically require the attacker to trick the victim into submitting a request, but no special conditions or environment complexity is mentioned.  
- CSRF is generally considered low complexity because it only requires social engineering (sending a link or embedding a request).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker exploits the victim's privileges. The attacker does not need privileges themselves but relies on the victim being authenticated.  
- Since the attacker needs the victim to be authenticated, the attacker themselves has no privileges, but the victim must have some privileges.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, PR is from the attacker's perspective. The attacker has no privileges on the system.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link) to trigger the CSRF.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows changes within the same security scope (Icinga Director configuration).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description focuses on unauthorized changes, not data disclosure.  
- No explicit mention of data leakage or confidentiality breach.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can perform unauthorized changes to the monitoring environment configuration.  
- This is a clear integrity impact.  
- The impact is significant but not necessarily complete control over all data.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not explicitly mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- However, unauthorized changes to monitoring configuration could affect availability indirectly.  
- Since the description does not explicitly mention availability impact, we assign Low or None.  
- Given the potential for disruption, assign Low (L).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack performed over the network (web).                                                  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions; typical CSRF attack.                                               |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Attacker requires no privileges; relies on victim's session.                              |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact (e.g., click a link).                                                |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.44 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.3432  
= 0.6568

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Impact Score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.6568  
= 4.217

**Base Score:**

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (4.217 + 2.836)  
= Roundup (7.053)  
= 7.1

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L

#####289#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server.
- Allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections on the web-based management interface.
- Exploitation requires persuading a user of the REST API to follow a crafted link.
- Successful exploit could cause the affected system to reload (impact on availability).

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and exploits the web-based management interface via the network.  
- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must persuade a user to follow a crafted link (social engineering).  
- This is a bit more complex than just sending a request; it requires user interaction but no special conditions beyond that.  
- AC = Low (L) (since no special conditions or environment needed beyond user interaction)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated (no privileges required).  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must persuade a user to follow a crafted link.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web management interface and the system itself).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention any data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can cause the system to reload, but no mention of modifying data or code.  
- Reloading the system is more an availability impact than integrity.  
- I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- The system reload could cause a temporary denial of service or disruption.  
- This is a low impact on availability (not complete or prolonged outage).  
- A = Low (L)

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, only user interaction needed |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must follow crafted link |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | System reload causes low availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U),  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(3.66)  
= 3.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####290#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
NVIDIA DGX A100 SBIOS contains a vulnerability where a user may cause a dynamic variable evaluation by local access. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires "local access," meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; it just says "a user may cause..." which implies low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "a user may cause..." which implies the attacker must be a user on the system, but it does not specify if elevated privileges are required. Since it says "user" and not "administrator" or "root," we assume low privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required by another user. The attacker is a user on the system, so no additional user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in SBIOS (firmware), but the description does not indicate that the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from one component to another). It likely affects the same security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description only mentions denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description explicitly states "may lead to denial of service," which is an availability impact. The severity is not specified, but denial of service is typically at least Low. Since no indication of complete shutdown or permanent denial, we assign Low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Requires user privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Denial of service (availability impact) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.223 (approx)  
= approx 1.83

**Impact:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22  
= 1.32

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.15)  
= 3.2

#####291#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An attacker with access to the web application with vulnerable software could introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting a cross-site scripting payload into the 'dns.0.server' parameter."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must have access to the web application, which is typically over the network. The attack is performed by sending a payload to a parameter in the web app.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Cross-site scripting (XSS) usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. The description does not mention any special conditions or timing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs access to the web application, no mention of needing any privileges or authentication. This suggests no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attacker injects JavaScript, but for the script to execute, a user must visit the vulnerable page or trigger the payload. This requires user interaction (the victim user must load the malicious script).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript, which can affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the user’s data or session, but it does not mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component. Usually, reflected or stored XSS affects the same security scope (web application).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically a Low impact because it depends on the attacker’s ability to steal data via script.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript, potentially modifying data or actions performed by the user. This is a Low impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must interact (visit page) for script to execute                                     |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the vulnerable component                                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible disclosure of sensitive info                                                    |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible modification of data or actions via script                                      |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####292#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is a deadlock caused by closing an event channel in the Linux kernel.
- The deadlock occurs when closing is done in parallel with an unrelated Xen console action and handling of a Xen console interrupt in an unprivileged guest.
- The action is triggered by removal of a paravirtual device.
- The issue affects Linux kernels using queued-RW-locks (not 32-bit Arm guests).
- The deadlock can cause a denial of service (system hang or freeze).
- The attack involves an unprivileged guest (unprivileged user context).
- The attack vector involves interaction with the Xen console and event channels, which are kernel-level mechanisms.
- The deadlock is triggered by concurrent operations, implying some complexity.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (Linux kernel).
- The impact is primarily on availability (deadlock causing denial of service).
- Confidentiality and integrity impacts are not mentioned.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by actions in an unprivileged guest involving Xen console interrupts and event channel closing.  
- The attack requires interaction with the Xen console and event channels, which are accessible over the virtualized environment.  
- Since the attack can be performed remotely from an unprivileged guest VM (no physical or local access required), the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The deadlock occurs due to a race condition between closing an event channel and unrelated Xen console actions.  
- The description mentions the chance of triggering the deadlock is "not neglectable," but it requires specific timing and concurrency.  
- This implies the attack complexity is **High (H)** because it depends on timing and race conditions.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description states the handling of a Xen console interrupt in an "unprivileged guest."  
- This means no special privileges are required inside the guest.  
- So, **Privileges Required = None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack involves actions performed by the attacker (closing event channels, Xen console interrupts).  
- No mention of requiring another user to interact.  
- So, **User Interaction = None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel inside the guest.  
- The deadlock affects the same security authority (kernel).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Scope = Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- So, **Confidentiality = None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
- So, **Integrity = None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The deadlock causes a denial of service (system hang or freeze).  
- This is a **High (H)** impact on availability.

| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact mentioned.                                                            |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or standard tables:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.318  
= 8.22 × 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.5952 + 2.22)  
= Round_up (5.8152)  
= 5.8

#####293#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Product: jshERP v3.3  
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in the function `findInOutDetail()`  
- Cause: Insufficient filtering of `column` and `order` parameters, allowing bypass of protection in `safeSqlParse` method  
- Impact: An attacker can execute SQL Injection  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web application controller function, which likely receives input over the network (HTTP request).  
- Therefore, the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload that bypasses the protection mechanism.  
- However, the description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.  
- SQL Injection typically has low complexity if input is not properly sanitized.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, SQL Injection in a web app parameter is exploitable without authentication unless stated otherwise.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request; no user interaction is needed for the attack to succeed.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows SQL Injection, which can lead to unauthorized data access or modification within the same security scope (the database and application).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized disclosure of data.  
- The description implies the attacker can retrieve data by bypassing protections.  
- This is at least a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **C = High (H)** (assuming attacker can extract sensitive data)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data modification, but SQL Injection typically allows it.  
- To be conservative, assume at least low impact on integrity.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but the description does not mention availability impact.  
- Assume no impact on availability.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via web request |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (data disclosure) |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (possible data modification) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.3432  
= 0.6568

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.6568  
= 4.22

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(8.11)  
= 8.1

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Orthanc versions before 1.12.2 are affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability was present in the server's error reporting."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Affected component:** Server's error reporting  
- **Versions affected:** Orthanc versions before 1.12.2

Reflected XSS typically involves an attacker tricking a user into clicking a malicious link that causes the server to reflect malicious script back to the user's browser. This can lead to execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted request to the server, which reflects the malicious script.  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- The attack can be performed over the network.  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Reflected XSS usually requires the attacker to craft a specific input and lure a victim to click a malicious link.  
- However, the vulnerability itself is straightforward and does not require special conditions on the server side.  
- Therefore, the complexity is low.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the server to exploit reflected XSS.  
- The attack is performed by sending crafted requests.  
**Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Reflected XSS requires the victim to click a malicious link or interact with the attacker-controlled content.  
- So, user interaction is required.  
**Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the server's error reporting, but the impact is on the user's browser (client-side).  
- However, in CVSS v3.1, scope is about whether the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Since the vulnerability allows code execution in the user's browser, which is outside the server's security scope, the scope is changed.  
**Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from the user's browser.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- Usually rated as Low (L) because the attacker can only access data accessible to the user.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute scripts in the user's browser, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- Rated as Low (L).  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability of the server or service.  
- No denial of service is implied.  
**Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network                                                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                                                                      |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact (click link)                                                        |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact crosses from server to user's browser (different security scope)                   |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Partial loss of confidentiality (e.g., cookie theft)                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Partial loss of integrity (e.g., script execution)                                        |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability                                                                |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore:**  
Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 7.52 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score:**  
= If Impact ≤ 0, then 0, else:  
If Scope Changed:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × (2.95 + 2.69), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × 5.64, 10))  
= round_up(6.09)  
= 6.1

#####295#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Nextcloud server OAuth codes: they did not expire.
- An attacker who intercepts an OAuth authorization code can authenticate at any time.
- Exploitation requires intercepting an OAuth code from a user session.
- No mention of needing privileges on the system.
- No mention of user interaction required for the attacker.
- Impact: attacker can authenticate as the user indefinitely (confidentiality, integrity, availability impact).
- The vulnerability is fixed by invalidating OAuth codes after 10 minutes.

---

### Metric Analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must intercept an OAuth code from a user session.  
- OAuth codes are typically transmitted over the network (e.g., HTTPS).  
- Interception implies network access, possibly via man-in-the-middle or network sniffing.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must intercept an OAuth code, which requires some conditions (e.g., network sniffing, man-in-the-middle, or other interception techniques).  
- This is not trivial but also not highly complex if the attacker is on the same network or can perform MITM.  
- Since the attacker needs to intercept a code, which is a specific condition, the complexity is **High (H)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the Nextcloud server or the victim's device.  
- They only need to intercept the OAuth code.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker intercepts a code from a user session, but the user does not need to perform any action to enable the attack (the user is just using the service normally).  
- The attacker exploits a weakness in the OAuth code handling, not requiring user interaction to trigger the attack.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to authenticate as the user, gaining access to the user's account.  
- This is a privilege escalation from the user session to the attacker.  
- However, the vulnerability is within the same security scope (Nextcloud server).  
- The impact is on the same system, no change in scope.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can authenticate as the user, gaining access to all data the user can access.  
- This is a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can authenticate as the user and perform actions on their behalf, modifying data.  
- So, **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker can authenticate as the user, but no direct mention of availability impact (e.g., denial of service).  
- However, since the attacker can impersonate the user, they could delete or modify data, potentially impacting availability.  
- This is typically considered **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on the scenario.  
- Given the ability to authenticate as the user indefinitely, they could disrupt availability.  
- To be conservative, assign **High (H)** availability impact.

---

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector (intercept OAuth code) |
| AC     | H     | Interception requires specific conditions (MITM, sniffing) |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | H     | Full access to user data |
| I      | H     | Can modify user data |
| A      | H     | Can disrupt availability by acting as user |

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

---

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for confirmation)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:H = 0.44
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.56

**Impact = 6.42 * ISC**  
ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

Impact = 6.42 * 0.915 = 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.56, 10)) = round_up(8.44) = 8.4 → 8.4 rounds to 8.4 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

**Final Base Score: 8.4 (High severity)**

# Final output:

AV: Network (N)  
AC: High (H)  
PR: None (N)  
UI: None (N)  
S: Unchanged (U)  
C: High (H)  
I: High (H)  
A: High (H)

#####296#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Code-projects Simple School Management System 1.0 allows SQL Injection via the 'apass' parameter at "School/index.php."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a web parameter ("apass" parameter at "School/index.php"). This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically require no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. Unless otherwise stated, assume low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges. Usually, SQLi on a public-facing parameter means no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the malicious input directly; no user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  SQL Injection typically affects the same security scope (the database and application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure. Since the description does not specify the extent, but SQLi usually allows reading data, assign Low or High. Given no explicit mention of full data disclosure, assign **Low (L)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL Injection can allow data modification. Again, no explicit mention, but generally SQLi can modify data. Assign **Low (L)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL Injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but no mention here. Assign **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via web parameter |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible data disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible data modification |
| A      | N     | No impact on availability mentioned |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.40)  
= 6.4

#####297#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in WPvivid WordPress plugin (versions ≤ 0.9.94).  
- Missing capability check on restore() and get_restore_progress() functions.  
- Allows **unauthenticated attackers** to invoke these functions.  
- Attackers can obtain **full file paths** if they have access to a backup ID.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated but can invoke functions remotely (likely via HTTP requests to the WordPress plugin).  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to have a backup ID to exploit the vulnerability.  
- The description does not specify that obtaining the backup ID is difficult or requires special conditions.  
- However, the need for a backup ID adds some complexity (not trivial).  
- This suggests **AC:H (High)** because the attacker must have or guess a valid backup ID, which is a precondition.  
- If the backup ID is easily guessable or obtainable, AC would be Low, but since it's not specified, we assume High.  

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is **unauthenticated**, so no privileges are required.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can invoke the functions directly; no user interaction is required.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to full file paths (information disclosure).  
- The impact is on the same component (plugin/WordPress instance).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can obtain full file paths.  
- This is an information disclosure but limited to file paths, not file contents or sensitive data.  
- This is a **Low** confidentiality impact.  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the attacker can modify data.  
- **I:N (None)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the attacker can affect availability.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack possible |
| AC     | H     | Requires backup ID (non-trivial) |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same scope |
| C      | L     | Disclosure of file paths (low impact) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:H (0.44)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.2707  
≈ 2.224

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.4124

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.4124 + 2.224)  
= Round_up (3.6364)  
= 3.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Affects: a-blog cms versions prior to certain fixed versions
- Impact: A user with contributor or higher privilege may execute arbitrary script on the browser of another user who accesses the website.
- Exploitation: Requires a user with contributor or higher privilege to perform the attack.
- Result: Execution of arbitrary script in the context of another user's browser.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed over the web (the attacker must have contributor or higher privilege on the CMS, then the script executes in the browser of another user who visits the site).  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access to the victim's machine.  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (web).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must have contributor or higher privileges to inject the script. This implies some level of complexity (not trivial).  
- However, once the attacker has the required privileges, the attack is straightforward.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor or higher privileges.  
- Contributor is a non-administrative role but is a privileged role compared to an unauthenticated user.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges means privileges that provide basic user capabilities but not administrative.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim user to visit the website to execute the script in their browser.  
- This means user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.04

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**

#####299#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress, versions ≤ 9.1.0
- Attack vector: Injection via shortcode attributes, executed when a user accesses the page
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
- Impact: Arbitrary script execution in the context of users who view the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by submitting crafted input via a shortcode attribute, which is stored and executed when a user accesses the page.  
- The attacker must be authenticated and have contributor-level permissions, so the attack is not purely remote without authentication.  
- However, the attacker can perform the attack remotely via the web interface (WordPress admin or contributor interface).  
- The attack does not require physical or local access to the machine.  
- Since the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the web interface, the vector is considered **Adjacent (A)** or **Network (N)**?  
- In CVSS, "Network" means the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network without special access. "Adjacent" means the attacker must be on the same shared physical or logical network.  
- Here, the attacker must be authenticated, but the attack is performed over the network (HTTP).  
- CVSS guidance states that if the attacker must be authenticated but can exploit remotely over the network, AV is **Network (N)**.  
- So, **AV:N**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.  
- The attacker must craft a stored XSS payload via shortcode attributes.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- The attack is straightforward once the attacker has contributor access.  
- So, **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor-level is not admin, but it is a low privilege level.  
- According to CVSS, "Low" means privileges that provide basic user capabilities but not administrative.  
- So, **PR:L**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires a victim user to access the page containing the injected script for the payload to execute.  
- The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without the victim's interaction (viewing the page).  
- So, **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows script execution in the context of the WordPress site.  
- The impact is limited to the same security scope (the WordPress application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- So, **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the victim user.  
- This is a **Low** confidentiality impact because the attacker can steal some information but not necessarily full system data.  
- So, **C:L**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a **Low** integrity impact because the attacker can modify data or perform actions but not fully control the system.  
- So, **I:L**

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- No indication of denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- So, **A:N**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | L     | Requires contributor-level privileges |
| UI     | R     | Victim must view the injected page |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible disclosure of sensitive info |
| I      | L     | Possible modification of data or actions |
| A      | N     | No impact on availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62 ≈ 8.22 × 0.201 ≈ 1.65

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.52 + 1.65) = Roundup (4.17) = 4.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in ali Forms Contact Form builder with drag & drop for WordPress – Kali Forms. This issue affects Contact Form builder with drag & drop for WordPress – Kali Forms: from n/a through 2.3.36.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Authorization Bypass  
- **Cause:** User-controlled key (likely a parameter or token that the user can manipulate)  
- **Affected component:** WordPress plugin (Kali Forms)  
- **Impact:** Bypass authorization, which means an attacker can perform actions or access data without proper permissions.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS base metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Since this is a WordPress plugin vulnerability, and the attacker can exploit it remotely via the web (likely over HTTP), the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is an authorization bypass through a user-controlled key, which suggests no special conditions or environment needed. The attacker just needs to control the key. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Authorization bypass usually means the attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They can bypass authorization controls. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is exploiting the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is required. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  Authorization bypass typically affects the same security scope (the application itself). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Authorization bypass can allow unauthorized access to data. The impact is likely **Low (L)** because it bypasses authorization but may not expose all data or highly sensitive data.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Authorization bypass can allow unauthorized modification of data or actions. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  There is no indication that the vulnerability affects availability. So, **None (N)**.

- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(6.42) = 6.4

| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (5.88 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (9.77)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.1.3 and Manage Component 8.10 through 8.11
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Impact: Allows an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
CSRF attacks typically require the attacker to trick a user into submitting a request, usually via the web (network). The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- **AV:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., click a link or visit a malicious site). This is a common and straightforward attack, so complexity is low.  
- **AC:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system; the attack leverages the victim's privileges.  
- **PR:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
The attack requires the user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious website or click a link).  
- **UI:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
CSRF attacks typically affect the same security scope (same application or domain). The vulnerability does not cause a change in scope.  
- **S:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
CSRF usually does not directly disclose information; it causes unauthorized actions. So confidentiality impact is none.  
- **C:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
CSRF allows unauthorized actions, which can modify data or state, so there is a low integrity impact.  
- **I:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
CSRF could potentially disrupt service if the unauthorized actions affect availability, but typically the impact is low or none. Since the description does not mention availability impact, assume none.  
- **A:** None (N)

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Low complexity, attacker just needs to trick user                                        |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required by attacker                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must interact (e.g., click a link)                                                  |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects same security scope                                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                                                                |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Unauthorized actions can modify data                                                     |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact mentioned                                                         |

#####305#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Mathtex v.1.05 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the length of the LaTeX string component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and exploits the vulnerability via the LaTeX string component. This implies the attack can be performed over a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Buffer overflow vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution typically require low complexity if the attacker can send a specially crafted input. No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can send input to trigger the overflow. No mention of needing any privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a malicious LaTeX string. No mention that a user must perform any action (like clicking a link). The attacker can directly send the input.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution. Usually, this means the attacker can execute code in the context of the vulnerable component. Unless the vulnerable component is a separate security boundary, scope is unchanged. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution typically allows full access to data handled by the process, so confidentiality is highly impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data and code.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to denial of service or worse.  
  **Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.97, 10))  
= round_up(9.85) = 9.9

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **9.9** (Critical).

#####306#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An incorrect permission assignment for critical resource vulnerability has been reported to affect Qsync Central. If exploited, the vulnerability could allow authenticated users to read or modify the resource via a network."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited "via a network."  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to be authenticated and exploit incorrect permissions. This suggests low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be "authenticated," so some privileges are required, but not high privileges. This implies **Low (L)** privileges required.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that the attacker needs another user to do anything. The attacker is authenticated and can exploit directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows reading or modifying a resource, but it does not mention that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components beyond the vulnerable component.  
  So, **Scope = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can "read" the resource, so confidentiality is impacted. Since it is a critical resource, but the description does not specify full disclosure, we assign **Low (L)**.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can "modify" the resource, so integrity is impacted. Again, no indication of full or complete modification, so **Low (L)**.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Requires authenticated user |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | L     | Read access to critical resource |
| I      | L     | Modify access to critical resource |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.19) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **5.2**, which is a **Medium** severity.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker, likely over the network (e.g., via a web interface).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require low complexity to exploit, as the attacker just needs to send crafted input.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability without any privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the victim usually needs to interact (e.g., click a link or visit a page) for the script to execute.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  XSS typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is usually considered Low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, which affects integrity at a Low level.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.33) = 5.3

#####309#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
TOTOLINK A8000RU v7.1cu.643_B20200521 was discovered to contain a hardcoded password for root stored in /etc/shadow.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability involves a hardcoded password in the device firmware. Exploiting this typically requires network access to the device (e.g., via SSH or web interface). Since the device is a network device, and the attacker can connect remotely, the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack involves using a known hardcoded password. No special conditions or environment are required. Therefore, the complexity is **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the password is hardcoded for root, the attacker does not need any privileges beforehand to exploit this. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker does not need any user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to root on the device itself. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Having root access via a hardcoded password allows full access to all confidential information on the device. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Root access allows full modification of system files and configurations. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Root access also allows the attacker to disrupt or disable the device, affecting availability. So, **High (H)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.36

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[5.88 + 4.36, 10])  
= Roundup(10.24) → 10.0 (max score is 10)

#####310#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: OS command injection
- Affected product: ELECOM wireless LAN routers
- Attacker: Network-adjacent attacker
- Privileges: Administrative privilege required
- Attack vector: Sending specially crafted request
- Impact: Execute arbitrary OS commands (likely full control)

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The attacker is "network-adjacent," meaning the attacker must be on the same local network or logically adjacent network segment, not anywhere on the internet.  
   - AV: Adjacent (A)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   The attacker sends a "specially crafted request" to exploit the vulnerability. No mention of complex conditions or timing. Usually, command injection via crafted requests is straightforward if you have the required privileges.  
   - AC: Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   The attacker must have "administrative privilege" to exploit the vulnerability. Administrative privilege is considered High (H) in CVSS v3.1.  
   - PR: High (H)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   No mention of user interaction required. The attacker sends a crafted request directly.  
   - UI: None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary OS commands, which likely affects the underlying system beyond the vulnerable component. However, since the vulnerability is in the router firmware and the impact is on the same system, scope is likely unchanged.  
   - S: Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   Arbitrary OS command execution can lead to full disclosure of information. This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
   - C: High (H)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   Arbitrary OS command execution allows full modification of system files and data.

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

---

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for confirmation)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator:

- AV:A = 0.62  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 0.89

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 0.89, 10)) = round_up(6.77) = 6.8 (rounded to 7.0)

So the base score is approximately 7.0 (High severity).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in 3DPrint Lite WordPress plugin before 1.9.1.5.
- No authorization and no file validation in the AJAX upload action.
- Allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to the web server.
- However, .htaccess prevents access to the uploaded files on Apache servers.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via an AJAX action, which is a web request.  
- The attacker can be anywhere on the internet (unauthenticated users).  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires no special conditions or environment; the attacker just needs to upload a file via the AJAX endpoint.  
- No complex conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker directly uploads the file via AJAX; no user interaction is needed.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows uploading arbitrary files to the web server.  
- The scope is whether the impact affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The plugin is part of the web server environment, and the uploaded file resides on the server filesystem.  
- However, the description does not mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The .htaccess prevents access to the uploaded files, so the impact is limited to the vulnerable component (plugin/web server).  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can upload files but cannot access them due to .htaccess.  
- No direct data disclosure is mentioned.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can upload arbitrary files, which could overwrite or add files on the server.  
- This can be considered a low impact on integrity because the attacker can add files but not necessarily modify existing files.  
- However, the description does not specify overwriting existing files, only uploading arbitrary files.  
- Uploading arbitrary files can be considered a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or disruption of service.  
- Uploading files alone does not necessarily impact availability.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required (unauthenticated)                                                  |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
= approx 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= approx 1.41

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(5.3)  
= 5.3

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **5.3**.

#####315#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
"uev (aka libuev) before 2.4.1 has a buffer overflow in epoll_wait if maxevents is a large number."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **uev (libuev)** is a userspace event library.
- The vulnerability is a **buffer overflow** in the function `epoll_wait`.
- The overflow occurs if `maxevents` is a large number.
- `epoll_wait` is a system call interface used to wait for I/O events.
- Since this is a userspace library, the attacker likely needs to call `epoll_wait` with a crafted large `maxevents` value.
- The attack vector is likely **local** because the attacker must run code on the system to call `epoll_wait`.
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which can lead to code execution or crash, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must invoke `epoll_wait` locally. This is not over the network or adjacent network.  
  **AV:L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The overflow occurs when `maxevents` is a large number. This is a straightforward condition, no special environment or timing required.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be able to call `epoll_wait`. This is a normal system call, so no special privileges are required.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker calls the function directly; no other user interaction is needed.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The buffer overflow is in a userspace library, but it may affect the process memory. The scope is likely **Unchanged** because the impact is within the same security authority (the process).  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Buffer overflow can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention it. Usually, buffer overflow can cause at least some confidentiality impact.  
  Assign **Low** to be conservative.  
  **C:L (Low)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Buffer overflow can allow code execution or modification of memory, so integrity is impacted.  
  Assign **High**.  
  **I:H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  Assign **High**.  
  **A:H (High)**

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local call to epoll_wait required |
| AC     | L     | Simple condition (large maxevents) |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to call epoll_wait |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope (process) |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure from overflow |
| I      | H     | Possible code or memory modification |
| A      | H     | Possible crash or DoS |

#####316#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: SQL Injection via manipulation of the argument `dataScope`.
- Affected component: unknown function in `/system/role/list`.
- Attack Vector: "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."
- Exploit status: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Severity: Critical.
- No version details available.
- Product uses rolling release.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."
- Remote attacks imply Network (N).

**AV = N**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- SQL Injection via argument manipulation.
- Usually, SQLi is straightforward if input is not sanitized.
- No mention of special conditions or timing.
- Public exploit available.
- So, Attack Complexity is Low (L).

**AC = L**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- No mention that attacker needs to be authenticated.
- The attack is launched remotely and no mention of login or privileges.
- Usually, SQLi on a public endpoint implies no privileges required.

**PR = N**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker manipulates an argument remotely.
- No mention that user interaction is required.
- Usually, SQLi does not require user interaction.

**UI = N**

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is in a web application function.
- SQL Injection can lead to data leakage or modification beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.
- Usually, SQLi affects the database, which is a different security authority than the application.
- This implies Scope is Changed (C).

**S = C**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.
- The description says "critical" and SQLi usually leads to high confidentiality impact.
- Since the exact impact is unknown, but critical severity and SQLi usually means high confidentiality impact.

**C = H**

---

**Integrity (I):**

- SQL Injection can allow data modification.
- Usually, SQLi can lead to data integrity compromise.

**I = H**

---

**Availability (A):**

- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service.
- No explicit mention of availability impact.
- Given critical severity and typical SQLi impact, availability impact is likely low or none.
- Since no mention, conservatively set to None (N).

**A = N**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)
- AC: L (Low)
- PR: N (None)
- UI: N (None)
- S: C (Changed)
- C: H (High)
- I: H (High)
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556

= 8.22 * 0.472

= approx 3.88

**Impact Sub-Score (Scope Changed):**

ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]

= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]

= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 1]

= 1 - 0.1936

= 0.8064

Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15

= 7.52 * (0.8064 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.8064 - 0.02)^15

= 7.52 * 0.7774 - 3.25 * (0.7864)^15

= 5.846 - 3.25 * (very small number)

(0.7864^15) ≈ 0.028

= 5.846 - 3.25 * 0.028

= 5.846 - 0.091

= 5.755

**Base Score =** Round up to one decimal place:

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0

Else if Scope Changed:

Base Score = min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10)

= 1.08 * (5.755 + 3.88) = 1.08 * 9.635 = 10.4 → capped at 10.0

- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.  
- No mention of special conditions or environment constraints.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- SQL Injection via a web parameter usually requires no privileges.  
- The attacker is likely unauthenticated.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request; no user interaction is needed.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection affects the database, which is part of the same security scope as the web application.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since the vulnerability is classified as critical, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow data modification or deletion.  
- Likely high impact on integrity.  
- **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summarize Metric Values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)

- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.345 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in cybernetikz Post views Stats allows Reflected XSS. This issue affects Post views Stats: from n/a through 1.3."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, reflected XSS is exploitable over the network (via HTTP requests).  
- **Privileges Required:** None, as the attacker just needs to send a crafted request.  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must click a malicious link or visit a crafted URL.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Impact:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, or other info accessible to the browser)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify the content displayed to the user)  
  - Availability: None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  No privileges are needed to exploit.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., click a link).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web app).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Some data can be stolen, but not full system compromise.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  The attacker can modify what the user sees.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No impact on availability.

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.3

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(6.41) = 6.4

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **6.4**.

Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's USB network driver (smsc75xx).
- The issue is a memory leak in the function smsc75xx_bind().
- The leak occurs when memory allocated is not freed in error cases.
- The vulnerability was reported by Syzbot.
- The backtrace shows the problem occurs during USB network device binding.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a USB network driver.  
- Exploitation requires interaction with the USB device (likely plugging in a USB device).  
- USB devices are considered Adjacent (A) because the attacker must be physically or logically adjacent to the target (e.g., connected via USB).  
- Network (N) would mean remote over network, which is not the case here.  
- Local (L) means attacker has local system access, which is not indicated.  
- Physical (P) means physical interaction is required, which could be argued here since USB device connection is physical. However, USB is often considered Adjacent in CVSS because it is a logical interface adjacent to the system.  
- Given the vulnerability is triggered by USB device binding, **AV:A (Adjacent)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a memory leak triggered during device binding.  
- The attacker must cause an error after memory allocation, which is a specific condition but not complex.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the USB driver binding process.  
- Typically, binding a USB device does not require privileges; the kernel handles it automatically.  
- The attacker can trigger this by plugging in a malicious USB device.  
- So, **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must plug in a USB device to trigger the vulnerability.  
- This is user interaction from the victim's perspective (the victim must connect the device).  
- So, **UI:R (Required)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a memory leak in the kernel.  
- The impact is within the kernel memory, no indication that it affects other components or privileges beyond the kernel.  
- The scope is likely **Unchanged (U)** because the impact is within the same security scope (kernel).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or security domains.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory leak could potentially expose sensitive information if the leaked memory contains sensitive data.  
- However, the description does not mention information disclosure, only a leak of allocated memory (non-freed memory).  
- Memory leak alone does not guarantee confidentiality impact unless data is exposed.  
- So, **C:L (Low)** is reasonable to reflect potential minor confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability is a memory leak, no indication of modification or corruption of data.  
- So, **I:N (None)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially cause denial of service.  
- The description does not explicitly mention DoS, but memory leaks can degrade availability over time.  
- So, **A:L (Low)** to reflect potential minor availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | USB device interface is adjacent network. |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity. |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to plug USB device. |
| UI     | R     | User must connect USB device. |
| S      | U     | Impact within kernel scope, no scope change. |
| C      | L     | Possible minor confidentiality impact due to memory leak. |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact. |
| A      | L     | Possible minor availability impact due to memory leak. |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:A = 0.62
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:N = 0.00
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.05, 10))  
= round_up(4.56) = 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####325#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
TinyMCE versions before 5.6.0 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. An unauthenticated and remote attacker could insert crafted HTML into the editor resulting in arbitrary JavaScript execution in another user's browser.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker can insert crafted HTML remotely without any special conditions mentioned. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack results in JavaScript execution in another user's browser, so the victim user must interact (e.g., open the page with the malicious content).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the editor (server-side), but the impact is on another user's browser (client-side). This means the scope is changed because the impact crosses security boundaries (from server to client).  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary JavaScript execution can lead to data theft or exposure of confidential information in the victim's browser. This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary JavaScript execution can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, impacting integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attacker over the network                                                          |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Unauthenticated attacker                                                                   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim user must interact (view the malicious content)                                    |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact crosses from server to client (changed scope)                                      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Arbitrary JS execution can lead to data theft                                             |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) — since Scope is Changed, PR:N multiplier is 0.85
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.1936]  
= 7.52 × 0.8064 ≈ 6.06

**Base Score:**  
= If Impact ≤ 0, then 0, else:  
If Scope is Changed:  
BaseScore = round_up (min (1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up (min (1.08 × (6.06 + 2.83), 10))  
= round_up (min (1.08 × 8.89, 10))  
= round_up (9.60)  
= 9.6 → rounded to 9.6 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N**

#####326#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Malicious code execution via path traversal in Apache Sling Servlets Resolver.
- Affects all versions before 2.11.0.
- Exploitation depends on system configuration.
- An attacker must have write access to the repository to upload a malicious script.
- Then, the attacker can trick the resolver to load the uploaded script.
- No mention of user interaction required.
- The attack is local to the system or repository (not clearly network-exploitable).
- The impact is code execution, which affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must have write access to the repository and upload a script.  
- The attack is not described as remotely exploitable over the network without prior access.  
- The repository is likely local or adjacent network accessible depending on deployment, but since it requires write access to the repository, which is often local or adjacent, not network-wide.  
- Given the description, the most fitting is **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)**.  
- Since the attacker must have write access to the repository (likely local or adjacent), and the exploit involves tricking the resolver to load the script, which is likely local or adjacent network.  
- Without more info, **Adjacent (A)** is appropriate (e.g., attacker on the same network segment or with access to the repository).  

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack depends on system configuration and requires the attacker to upload a script and then trick the resolver.  
- This suggests some conditions must be met, but no special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
- The complexity is not high, but not trivial either.  
- Given the dependency on configuration, **High (H)** is appropriate.  

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have write access to the repository.  
- Write access is a form of privileges, but the level is not specified as low or high.  
- Since the attacker must have some privileges (write access), but not necessarily admin or high privileges, **Low (L)** is appropriate.  

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required for the attack to succeed.  
- The attacker uploads a script and tricks the resolver.  
- No mention of needing another user to do something.  
- So, **None (N)**.  

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows code execution via the resolver loading a malicious script.  
- This likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., the resolver loads the script, potentially affecting the system).  
- Code execution usually implies scope change.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.  

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Malicious code execution can lead to data disclosure.  
- So, **High (H)**.  

**Integrity (I):**  
- Code execution allows modification of data.  
- So, **High (H)**.  

**Availability (A):**  
- Code execution can lead to denial of service or system disruption.  
- So, **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | A     | Requires write access to repository, likely adjacent network or local access.              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Depends on system configuration, not trivial.                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires write access (some privileges), but not high privileges.                         |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Code execution affects components beyond the vulnerable one.                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Code execution can lead to full data disclosure.                                          |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Code execution can modify data.                                                           |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Code execution can disrupt availability.                                                  |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.144 ≈ 1.183

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 × 0.915  
= 6.88

- Base Score = Roundup(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 × (6.88 + 1.183)  
= 1.08 × 8.063  
= 8.71 → Rounded up to 8.7 → CVSS rounds to 8.7 → 8.7 rounds to 8.7 (usually rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####327#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to a race condition between transmission (tx) work scheduling and socket close.  
- The issue involves asynchronous crypto handler and thread synchronization.  
- The fix involves reordering work scheduling and completion calls to avoid the race.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's networking stack (tls layer).  
- The issue involves socket operations (recvmsg/sendmsg), which are typically accessible over the network.  
- Since the vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending data over the network (e.g., TLS traffic), the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a race condition, which often requires precise timing or conditions to exploit.  
- Race conditions generally increase complexity.  
- However, the description does not mention any special conditions or environment constraints beyond normal operation.  
- Given that race conditions are usually non-trivial to exploit, **High (H)** complexity is appropriate.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability involves socket operations (recvmsg/sendmsg) which are typically accessible to unprivileged users or remote attackers.  
- No mention of needing elevated privileges.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is in kernel socket handling, triggered by network operations.  
- No user interaction required for exploitation.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel, which is a single security authority.  
- The issue is within the kernel and does not affect other components or security authorities.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention data leakage or confidentiality impact.  
- The race condition is about work scheduling and socket close, likely causing crashes or denial of service rather than data exposure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The race condition could potentially cause corrupted data or unexpected behavior in the kernel's crypto operations.  
- However, no explicit mention of data modification or integrity loss.  
- Given the nature of the issue, a **Low (L)** impact on integrity is reasonable (some potential for data corruption or manipulation).

**Availability (A):**  
- Race conditions in kernel code often lead to crashes or denial of service.  
- The description implies potential disruption of socket operations.  
- So, **Low (L)** impact on availability.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Network accessible vulnerability via socket operations.                                   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Race condition requires precise timing, increasing complexity.                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to exploit.                                                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction needed.                                                               |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects the kernel only, no scope change.                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact mentioned.                                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible low integrity impact due to race condition.                                     |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Possible low availability impact due to potential crashes or disruption.                  |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:H (0.44)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:L (0.22)  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.318  
= 8.22 * 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 * 0.3916  
= 2.35

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.35 + 2.22, 10))  
= round_up(4.57)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L**

#####328#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Sichuan Yougou Technology KuERP up to 1.0.4.
- Affects an unknown function in the file /runtime/log.
- The issue is improper output neutralization for logs.
- The vulnerability is classified as critical.
- Exploit has been publicly disclosed.
- Vendor was contacted but did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability involves improper output neutralization for logs.
- Usually, log injection or improper neutralization vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the attacker can send data that gets logged.
- Since the description does not specify local access or physical access, and the exploit is publicly known, it is likely exploitable over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is described as critical and publicly disclosed.
- No mention of special conditions or complex steps.
- Usually, improper output neutralization is straightforward to exploit.
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.
- Since the vulnerability is in logging, and the attacker can likely send data that gets logged, no privileges are required.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The vulnerability is related to logs, which are typically generated by system or application events.
- The attacker likely just needs to send data that gets logged; no user interaction is required.
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the logging function.
- Improper output neutralization for logs usually affects the same security authority (the logging component).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Improper output neutralization for logs typically leads to injection or log forging.
- This may not directly lead to confidentiality loss.
- No mention of data disclosure.
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**

- Log injection or improper neutralization can allow an attacker to forge or manipulate log entries.
- This is an integrity impact on the logs.
- Usually, this is considered a Low impact on integrity (the attacker can modify logs but not system files).
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- **A = None (N)**

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact = 6.42 × ISC_Base  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (5.3)  
= 5.3

#####329#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) version 1.0
- Vulnerable parameter: description parameter in /cupseasylive/statemodify.php
- Impact: Remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user and steal their session cookie credentials.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a URL that exploits insufficient encoding.  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond sending the URL.  
- This is a typical low complexity for XSS.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends a URL to an authenticated user, so the attacker does not need privileges on the target system.  
- The victim must be authenticated, but the attacker does not need privileges.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the user to click or visit the specially crafted URL.  
- So user interaction is required.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stealing session cookies, which affects the user's session and potentially the application security context.  
- However, the vulnerability is within the same security scope (the web application).  
- XSS typically does not change scope because it affects the same security authority.  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session cookie credentials, which is a high confidentiality impact.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute scripts in the user's context, potentially modifying data or actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies a high integrity impact.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- **Value: None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(Min(5.18 + 2.82, 10))  
= Roundup(8.0) = 8.0

#####330#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Any-Capture Any Sound Recorder 2.93.
- Affects the Registration Handler component.
- Manipulation of the argument "User Name/Key Code" leads to memory corruption.
- Attack can be launched on the local host.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack on the local host."  
- This implies the attacker must have local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- The attack involves argument manipulation leading to memory corruption, which is typically straightforward once local access is obtained.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not specify that the attacker needs any privileges beyond local access.  
- Since the attack is launched on the local host, but no mention of needing elevated privileges, assume None (N) or Low (L).  
- Usually, local attacks require at least some privileges, but if the user can run the program without elevated rights, PR = None (N).  
- Given the lack of detail, and that the attack is on the local host, assume PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker manipulates an argument, likely automated or direct.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to memory corruption in the same component.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or security authority.  
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not mention data leakage.  
- Since the impact is memory corruption, but no explicit mention of confidentiality loss, assume Low (L) or None (N).  
- To be conservative, assume Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to modification of data or code.  
- This suggests at least Low (L) impact on integrity.  
- Assume Integrity = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Assume Low (L) impact on availability.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (since Scope is Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.306  
≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.4746  
= 0.5254

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.5254  
= 3.37

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.37 + 2.52)  
= Round_up (5.89)  
= 5.9

#####331#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Path traversal vulnerability in ZipCompressor of MyFiles prior to SMR Jan-2024 Release 1 in Android 11 and Android 12, and version 14.5.00.21 in Android 13 allows local attackers to write arbitrary file.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows **local attackers** to write arbitrary files.  
  Since the attacker must be local (not remote/network), AV = **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Path traversal vulnerabilities typically do not require complex conditions beyond the ability to supply crafted input.  
  No mention of special conditions or timing, so AC = **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as a "local attacker," but no mention of needing elevated privileges.  
  Usually, local path traversal vulnerabilities require at least some user privileges to run the vulnerable application.  
  Since it's a local app (MyFiles), likely the attacker needs to be a normal user on the device, so PR = **Low (L)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The vulnerability is exploited by the attacker directly (local attacker). No mention of needing another user to do something.  
  So, UI = **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows writing arbitrary files, which can affect system files or other components outside the vulnerable component.  
  However, since this is a local app vulnerability, and the impact is on files, it likely affects the same security scope (the app or user).  
  No explicit indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  So, Scope = **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability allows writing arbitrary files, but no mention of reading or leaking information.  
  So, Confidentiality impact = **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Writing arbitrary files impacts integrity. The attacker can modify or create files arbitrarily.  
  Since arbitrary files can be written, this is a **High (H)** impact on integrity.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
  So, Availability = **None (N)**.

### Summary of metrics:

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:H (High)

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.42) = 5.4 → 5.4 rounds to 5.4 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
SQL Injection vulnerability in ABO.CMS v.5.9.3, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the d parameter in the Documents module.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically require low complexity to exploit if no additional conditions are mentioned. The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "remote attackers" which implies no privileges are required to exploit.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is mentioned or implied.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., system-level code execution). This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the system, so availability impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 stores potentially sensitive information in log files that could be read by a local user."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability involves reading log files by a local user. The attacker must have local access to the system to read these files.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  There is no indication of any special conditions or complexity to exploit this vulnerability beyond local access. Reading log files is straightforward once local access is obtained.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "could be read by a local user," implying the attacker needs to be a local user but does not specify that elevated privileges are required. So, the attacker likely needs low privileges (a normal user account).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of any user interaction required for the attacker to read the log files. The attacker is a local user who can directly access the files.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects information disclosure within the same component (log files stored by the application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Sensitive information is exposed to a local user. This is a confidentiality impact. Since the information is "potentially sensitive," but no indication of total compromise, this is likely Low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No indication that the vulnerability affects data integrity.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact = 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 × 0.22 = 1.32

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 1.83, 10))

#####334#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Juanpao JPShop up to 1.5.02.
- Affects the function actionIndex in /api/controllers/admin/app/ComboController.php.
- The argument pic_url can be manipulated to allow unrestricted upload.
- The attack can be initiated remotely.
- The exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- The vulnerability is in an API controller, so the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description mentions "unrestricted upload" by manipulating an argument.  
- No mention of special conditions or complex steps.  
- Likely low complexity.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in an admin controller (`/admin/app/ComboController.php`), which might suggest some privilege is needed.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say that authentication or privileges are required.  
- The attacker can manipulate the argument remotely, but is it authenticated?  
- Since it is an admin controller, it is likely that some privileges are required (e.g., admin or at least logged-in user).  
- Without explicit info, but given the path, assume **Low (L)** privileges required (e.g., authenticated user but not admin).  
- If it were no privileges, it would be explicitly stated.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker manipulates the argument directly.  
- No mention of needing another user to do something.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows unrestricted upload, which can lead to remote code execution or similar impact.  
- The vulnerable component is the API controller, but the impact likely affects the broader system (e.g., server).  
- This suggests the scope is Changed (C).  
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unrestricted upload can lead to code execution or data exposure.  
- The description does not mention direct data disclosure, but unrestricted upload can lead to high confidentiality impact.  
- Given the critical rating and unrestricted upload, assume High (H) confidentiality impact.  
- C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload can allow an attacker to modify or add files, potentially altering system behavior.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).  
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Unrestricted upload can lead to denial of service or system compromise.  
- Availability impact is likely High (H).  
- A = High (H).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.68

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 × 0.915 ≈ 6.88

- Base Score = Roundup(Min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 × (6.88 + 2.68) = 1.08 × 9.56 = 10.33 → capped at 10.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to `fs/mount_setattr`.
- The issue involves improper cleanup of `mount_kattr` references.
- If path lookup fails, an additional reference leak occurs.
- This happens when an idmapped mount is requested.
- The problem is a resource leak (reference leak), which could lead to resource exhaustion or other indirect impacts.

---

### Step 1: Determine the Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's mount attribute setting function.
- Mount operations are typically local or adjacent.
- However, mounting is generally a local operation requiring local access.
- Therefore, **AV: Local (L)**.

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The issue occurs when a path lookup fails during an idmapped mount request.
- This is a specific condition but not particularly complex to trigger if the attacker has local access.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- Therefore, **AC: Low (L)**.

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- Mount operations require some level of privileges.
- Typically, mounting requires root or elevated privileges.
- Since this is a kernel-level mount operation, the attacker likely needs **High (H)** privileges.
- Therefore, **PR: High (H)**.

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The vulnerability is in kernel code handling mount attributes.
- No user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited once privileges are obtained.
- Therefore, **UI: None (N)**.

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel.
- The issue is a resource leak within the kernel's mount attribute handling.
- The impact is confined to the kernel itself, no indication that it affects other components or security domains.
- Therefore, **Scope: Unchanged (U)**.

#### Confidentiality (C)
- The vulnerability is a reference leak.
- No indication that confidentiality of data is affected.
- Therefore, **C: None (N)**.

#### Integrity (I)
- No indication that data integrity is affected.
- The issue is a resource leak, not data modification.
- Therefore, **I: None (N)**.

#### Availability (A)
- Resource leaks can lead to resource exhaustion.
- This could degrade system availability or cause denial of service.
- Therefore, **A: Low (L)** (since it is a leak, not immediate crash or full DoS).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local mount operation |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges (root) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact confined to kernel |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Resource leak may affect availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:N = 0.00
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(2.20)  
= 2.2 → Rounded to 2.2 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

#####336#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS) in webmin v.2.105 and earlier allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the "Execute cron job as" tab Input field.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a web interface ("Execute cron job as" tab input field). This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require crafting a payload but do not require special conditions beyond that. Since the attacker only needs to send a crafted payload, the complexity is low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can send a payload to the input field. Usually, XSS in web applications can be exploited without any privileges. The description does not mention needing to be authenticated.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attacker usually needs the victim user to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., by viewing a page or clicking a link). Since this is a stored or reflected XSS, the victim must interact with the payload for code execution.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code via XSS. However, XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application). It does not usually affect other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or scripts, potentially modifying data or actions on behalf of the user. This is a Low impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.84)  
= round_up(5.35)  
= 5.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A Blind SSRF vulnerability exists in the "Crawl Meta Data" functionality of SEO Panel version 4.10.0. This makes it possible for remote attackers to scan ports in the local environment.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by attackers over the network.  
- SSRF typically involves sending crafted requests to the vulnerable server, which then makes requests internally.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Blind SSRF usually requires sending a crafted request, which is straightforward.  
- So, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is described as "remote attackers," implying no authentication or privileges needed.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention that a user must interact for the attack to succeed.  
- SSRF is typically triggered by the attacker sending a request directly.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows scanning ports in the local environment, which is internal to the vulnerable system.  
- The impact is on the same security authority (the vulnerable application and its environment).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can scan ports in the local environment, which may reveal information about internal services.  
- This is an information disclosure but limited in scope.  
- So, Confidentiality impact is Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention any modification of data or system integrity.  
- I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of disruption or denial of service.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |

| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                     |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact within the same security scope            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Information disclosure (port scanning info)      |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                               |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                            |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22  
= 1.32

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(5.21)  
= 5.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in coderd-repos Eva 1.0.0
- Affects HTTP POST Request Handler, specifically the argument "property"
- Leads to SQL Injection
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in an HTTP POST request handler.
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- SQL Injection typically requires low complexity if the input is directly injectable.
- No mention of special conditions or environment constraints.
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the server.
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.
- Likely no privileges required.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request.
- No mention that a user must perform any action (like clicking a link).
- Exploit can be automated.
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the HTTP POST request handler of the application.
- SQL Injection typically allows the attacker to affect the database or data beyond the vulnerable component.
- This usually means the impact crosses security boundaries.
- Therefore, **Scope = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.
- Since it is classified as critical and no limitation is mentioned, assume high impact.
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**

- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.
- Assume high impact.
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**

- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but no explicit mention.
- Since it's critical, and SQLi can cause availability issues, assume at least low.
- But since no explicit mention, to be conservative, assume **Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via HTTP POST |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.99

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 7.52 * 0.849 ≈ 6.39

- Base Score (Scope Changed):

If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.39 + 3.99, 10])  
= Roundup (10.38, 10)  
= 10.0

#####339#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Qidianbang qdbcrm 1.1.0, specifically in the Password Reset functionality at /user/edit?id=2.
- Attack Vector: The attack may be launched remotely.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and can be used.
- Privileges: Not explicitly stated, but CSRF typically requires the victim to be authenticated.
- User Interaction: Required (victim must interact, e.g., visit a malicious page).
- Impact: Manipulation leads to CSRF, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the action.
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but usually CSRF affects the same security scope (web application).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- "The attack may be launched remotely."
- CSRF attacks are typically launched over the network (via the victim's browser).
- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious page.
- No special conditions or timing required beyond user interaction.
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated (have privileges).
- The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must have some.
- Since the attacker exploits the victim's privileges, PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs the victim to have some privileges.
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**

- CSRF requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page).
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**

- CSRF attacks typically do not change scope; the impact is within the same security authority.
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**

- CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions, but does it disclose information?
- The description does not mention data disclosure.
- Usually, CSRF affects integrity more than confidentiality.
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**

- CSRF allows unauthorized actions, such as changing passwords or data.
- This is an integrity impact.
- The description says "manipulation leads to CSRF," which implies unauthorized changes.
- Likely Low (L) or High (H)?
- Since it is password reset, which can be critical, it could be High.
- But the description is vague; let's assume Low (L) because it is "some unknown functionality" and not full compromise.
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of availability impact.
- A = None (N)

---

### Summary of metrics:

- AV: Network (N)
- AC: Low (L)
- PR: Low (L)
- UI: Required (R)
- S: Unchanged (U)
- C: None (N)
- I: Low (L)
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 2: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22 = 1.412

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.412 + 2.068)  
= Round_up (3.48)  
= 3.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
User browser may be forced to execute JavaScript and pass the authentication cookie to the attacker leveraging the XSS vulnerability located at "/gui/terminal_tool.cgi" in the "data" parameter.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by tricking the user into executing JavaScript in their browser. The attacker can exploit this remotely by getting the user to visit a malicious link or page.  
  This is a **Network (N)** vector.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload and lure the user to trigger it. This is a typical XSS scenario, which usually has **Low (L)** complexity because no special conditions are required beyond user interaction.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system; the attack targets the user's browser.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must interact by visiting a malicious page or clicking a link to trigger the XSS.  
  Therefore, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the user's browser session and can lead to theft of authentication cookies, but it does not escalate privileges or affect other components beyond the vulnerable web application.  
  The scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can steal authentication cookies, which can lead to unauthorized access to user data. This is a **High (H)** impact on confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of the user. This is a **High (H)** impact on integrity.

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
  So, **None (N)**.

| Privileges Required (PR) | N  | No privileges needed                                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI) | R     | User must interact (visit malicious page)                                                 |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component                                                    |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Attacker can steal authentication cookies                                                 |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, modifying data                                 |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability sub-score:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact sub-score:**  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.1936]  
= 6.42 × 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(8.01) = 8.0

#####341#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"A race condition was addressed with additional validation. This issue is fixed in macOS Sonoma 14.4, macOS Monterey 12.7.4, macOS Ventura 13.6.5. An app may be able to access protected user data."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type of vulnerability:** Race condition leading to unauthorized access to protected user data.
- **Impact:** An app (likely local or sandboxed) may be able to access protected user data.
- **Attack vector:** Since it involves an app accessing data, it is likely local or adjacent, but not network-based.
- **Privileges required:** The app is able to access protected data, so it may require some privileges (e.g., running on the device).
- **User interaction:** Not explicitly mentioned.
- **Scope:** Not explicitly mentioned, but since it involves access to user data, it may or may not affect other components.
- **Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability:** The main impact is on confidentiality (access to protected data). No mention of integrity or availability impact.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves an app on the system accessing data.  
- Not network-based, so **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Race conditions are generally tricky but if an app can exploit it, complexity is likely low.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.  
- Assign **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The app is able to access protected user data, so it likely requires some privileges (e.g., user-level app).  
- Not "None" because the app must be installed or running on the device.  
- Assign **Low (L)** privileges (e.g., normal user privileges).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required for the exploit.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The issue allows an app to access protected user data, but no indication that it affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Likely **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The app may access protected user data, so confidentiality is impacted.  
- Since it is "protected user data," but no indication of full data disclosure, assign **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification of data.  
- Assign **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- Assign **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local app access |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 1.87

**Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78) = 6.42 × 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(1.41 + 1.87) = round_up(3.28) = 3.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in a WordPress plugin allowing arbitrary file uploads.
- The vulnerability exists due to missing file type validation in a specific function.
- Attackers must be authenticated with Editor access or higher.
- Exploitation could lead to remote code execution on the affected server.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker uploads files to the server via the plugin's functionality.  
- Since this is a WordPress plugin, the attack is performed over the network (HTTP request).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to missing file type validation, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with Editor access or above.  
- Editor is a high-level role but not administrator.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges correspond to roles with some privileges but not full admin.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is authenticated and performs the upload themselves. No other user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows uploading files that may lead to remote code execution on the server hosting the WordPress site.  
- The impact crosses from the plugin (application) to the underlying server (system).  
- This means the scope is changed.  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Remote code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- At minimum, this is a high confidentiality impact.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Remote code execution allows arbitrary code execution, which can modify or delete data.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Remote code execution can disrupt or take down the server or service.  
- **Value:** High (H)

#####343#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"create_empty_lvol in drivers/mtd/ubi/vtbl.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.4 can attempt to allocate zero bytes, and crash, because of a missing check for ubi->leb_size."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically in a function that can cause a crash by attempting to allocate zero bytes.
- The impact is a crash, which implies a denial of service (DoS).
- The crash is caused by a missing check, so it is likely a programming error.
- The attack vector is likely remote or local depending on how the function is triggered.
- Since it is a kernel driver, it is unlikely that this can be triggered remotely over a network without local access.
- The function is in a driver related to MTD (Memory Technology Device) and UBI (Unsorted Block Images), which are related to flash memory management.
- Typically, exploiting such a vulnerability requires local access or at least adjacent access (e.g., local user or adjacent network).
- The vulnerability causes a crash (availability impact).
- No indication of confidentiality or integrity impact.
- No indication that user interaction is required.
- Privileges required: Since it is a kernel driver, it is likely that some privileges are required to trigger this (e.g., local user with some access to the device).

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Network (N): Unlikely, as this is a kernel driver function related to flash memory.  
- Adjacent (A): Possibly, if the attacker can interact with the device over an adjacent network or bus.  
- Local (L): Most likely, since the attacker needs to interact with the kernel driver locally.  
- Physical (P): Unlikely, no physical access needed.  

**Chosen:** Local (L)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Low (L): The vulnerability is a missing check causing a crash, which is straightforward to trigger if the attacker can call the function with zero bytes.  
- High (H): If triggering requires complex conditions or timing.  

**Chosen:** Low (L)

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- None (N): If any user can trigger it without privileges.  
- Low (L): If the attacker needs some privileges (e.g., user-level access).  
- High (H): If root or administrative privileges are needed.  

Since this is a kernel driver, and the function is related to memory technology devices, it is likely that the attacker needs at least some privileges to interact with the device (e.g., user-level access). It is unlikely that unprivileged users can trigger this.

**Chosen:** Low (L)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- None (N): If the attacker can trigger the vulnerability without any user interaction.  
- Required (R): If a user must perform some action (e.g., open a file, click a link).  

This is a kernel function triggered by a system call or device interaction, so no user interaction is required.

**Chosen:** None (N)

---

**Scope (S):**  
- Unchanged (U): If the vulnerability affects resources managed by the same security authority.  
- Changed (C): If the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  

A kernel crash affects the entire system, but the vulnerability is within the kernel itself, so the scope is unchanged.

**Chosen:** Unchanged (U)

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- None (N): No confidentiality impact.  
- Low (L): Some information disclosure.  
- High (H): Complete disclosure.  

No indication of confidentiality impact.

**Chosen:** None (N)

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- None (N): No integrity impact.  
- Low (L): Some modification possible.  
- High (H): Complete modification.  

No indication of integrity impact.

**Chosen:** None (N)

---

**Availability (A):**  
- None (N): No availability impact.  
- Low (L): Partial impact on availability.  
- High (H): Complete denial of service.  

The vulnerability causes a crash, which is a denial of service. Kernel crash is a complete DoS.

**Chosen:** High (H)

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:N = 0.00
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 1.83, 10))

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue found in NetScout nGeniusOne v.6.3.4 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and cause a denial of service via a crafted file."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability via a crafted file. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit the vulnerability. Usually, arbitrary code execution via crafted files implies low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can execute arbitrary code, implying no privileges are required before the attack.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention that user interaction is required. Since the attacker sends a crafted file, it is likely that no user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution and denial of service. Usually, code execution vulnerabilities in an application do not affect other components beyond the vulnerable component unless explicitly stated. Since no mention of scope change is made, assume scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including confidentiality impact. So, confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description explicitly mentions denial of service, which impacts availability. The impact is likely High since DoS is caused by arbitrary code execution.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.77) = 9.8

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **9.8** (Critical).

#####345#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
swftools 0.9.2 was discovered to contain an Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability via the function dict_do_lookup in swftools/lib/q.c:1190.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the vulnerability details

- **Type:** Out-of-bounds Read  
  This typically allows an attacker to read memory outside the intended buffer, potentially leaking sensitive information.

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a function inside a library (swftools/lib/q.c). Since swftools is a command-line tool for working with SWF files, the attack likely requires the attacker to provide a crafted input file or data to the software. This suggests the attack is performed locally or via a file input.  
  However, if the software processes files that can be received over a network or shared folder, it could be Adjacent or Network. But swftools is a local tool, so the attacker must have local access to run it or provide input files.  
  **Most likely AV: Local (L)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities often require crafted input but no special conditions beyond that. No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
  **AC: Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attacker must run the software or provide input to it, but no mention of needing elevated privileges, assume no privileges required beyond user-level.  
  **PR: None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker likely needs to supply a crafted file or input to the software. This is direct interaction by the attacker, not a victim user. So no user interaction required.  
  **UI: None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Out-of-bounds read in a local application usually affects only the vulnerable component, not other components or system-wide. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S: Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure. The impact is likely Low or High depending on what data can be read. Since the description is generic, assume Low impact (some information leak).  
  **C: Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Out-of-bounds read does not modify data.  
  **I: None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication of denial of service or crash impact.  
  **A: None (N)**

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

#####346#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Severity: High
- Affected product: Confluence Data Center and Server (versions 7.13.0 and later)
- Attack vector: Remote (Network)
- Privileges required: Authenticated attacker (so not None, but likely Low or High)
- User interaction: None required
- Scope: Changed (from the example vector and typical RCE impact)
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: High
- CVSS v3.0 vector given as example: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H with score 8.0

---

### Step 1: Determine each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is Remote Code Execution over the network. So AV:N (Network).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The example vector uses AC:H (High). The description says "allows an authenticated attacker to expose assets susceptible to exploitation," which suggests some complexity. So AC:H.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated. Authentication usually corresponds to Low or High privileges. The example vector uses PR:H (High).  
  Since the attacker must be authenticated, but the description does not specify admin or high privileges, it could be Low or High. The example vector uses PR:H, so we will keep PR:H.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description says "does not require user interaction." So UI:N.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The example vector uses S:C (Changed). RCE usually leads to scope change because the attacker can execute code beyond their privileges. So S:C.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  High impact on confidentiality. So C:H.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  High impact on integrity. So I:H.

- **Availability (A):**  
  High impact on availability. So A:H.

---

### Step 2: Summarize each metric

- AV: N (Network)
- AC: H (High)
- PR: H (High)
- UI: N (None)
- S: C (Changed)
- C: H (High)
- I: H (High)
- A: H (High)

#####347#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in add_quiz.php (Quiz Handler component)
- Input: Manipulation of "Quiz Title/Quiz Description" argument with script tags
- Attack Vector: The attack may be initiated remotely
- Exploit status: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- Impact: XSS typically affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability to varying degrees depending on context

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack can be initiated remotely over the network (e.g., via a web request).
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack involves injecting script tags into input fields.
- No special conditions or environment needed.
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker only needs to send input to the web application.
- No authentication or privileges required.
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**

- For XSS, the attack requires a user to visit the maliciously crafted page or link to trigger the script.
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**

- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality (not full system compromise).
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**

- XSS can allow an attacker to modify the content seen by the user or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- This is typically Low impact on integrity.
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**

- XSS generally does not affect availability.
- A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack can be performed remotely over the network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (visit page) to trigger XSS |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, vulnerability affects same component |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact (data theft possible) |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (content manipulation) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.51 + 2.25)  
= Round_up (4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####348#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: IBM Security Access Manager Container (Verify Access Appliance and Docker versions 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.6.1)
- Vulnerability: Allows a remote attacker to gain access to the underlying system using man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to the underlying system.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and uses MITM techniques. MITM attacks typically require network access but not physical or local access.  
- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- MITM attacks generally require the attacker to be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic, which is not trivial but not very complex either.  
- However, MITM attacks often require some conditions (e.g., network position, lack of encryption).  
- Given the description, it suggests the attacker can perform MITM, so the complexity is not high.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is described as a "remote attacker" who can gain access via MITM. No mention of needing prior privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required for the attack. MITM attacks typically do not require user interaction.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker gains access to the underlying system, which suggests the impact crosses a security boundary (from the application/container to the underlying system).  
- This implies a change in scope.  
- S = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Gaining access to the underlying system implies a high confidentiality impact (full access to system data).  
- C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Access to the underlying system implies the attacker can modify system data or configurations.  
- I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Access to the underlying system could allow disruption or denial of service.  
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but full system access usually implies at least some availability impact.  
- To be conservative, assign High (H) availability impact.  
- A = High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attacker via MITM |
| AC     | L     | MITM attack complexity is low |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security boundary to underlying system |
| C      | H     | Full confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Full integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Full availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
  = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
  = 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
  = 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

- Base Score (Scope Changed) =  
  If Impact > 0:  
  1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)  
  = 1.08 * (6.88 + 3.91)  
  = 1.08 * 10.79 ≈ 11.65, but max is 10.0

- So, Base Score = 10.0 (Critical)

#####349#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Summary:
- Vulnerability in `trillium-http` and `trillium-client` before certain versions.
- Insufficient validation of outbound HTTP header names and values.
- Allows injection of `\r\n` sequences leading to HTTP request/response splitting.
- Attackers must have control over header names or values (untrusted input).
- Potential impacts: exfiltration of data, SSRF, pivoting attacks.
- Fixes involve rejecting or omitting invalid headers before network transmission.
- The vulnerability is exploitable when attacker controls headers, which implies some level of privilege or access to input that becomes headers.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The vulnerability involves sending crafted headers in requests or responses.
- The attacker must control header values/names that are sent over the network.
- Since this involves network requests/responses, and the attacker can send crafted headers remotely, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The attacker must be able to inject `\r\n` sequences into headers.
- This requires control over header values/names, but no special conditions beyond that.
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation, no complex conditions or timing required.
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- The attacker must have the ability to control header names or values.
- This implies the attacker can send requests with crafted headers or influence server responses.
- For client-side, attacker controls request headers (no privileges needed).
- For server-side, attacker controls response headers (likely requires some privilege or control over server response generation).
- The description says "attackers have sufficient control over headers" but does not specify needing authentication or elevated privileges.
- Since the attacker can send requests with crafted headers (typical in HTTP), **None (N)** privileges required.

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The attack involves sending crafted headers.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to "pivot to gain control over other parts of requests or responses," e.g., exfiltrating data from other requests, SSRF.
- This implies the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself.
- The scope is **Changed (C)**.

#### Confidentiality (C)
- The attacker can exfiltrate data from other requests.
- This is a **High (H)** impact on confidentiality.

#### Integrity (I)
- The attacker can manipulate requests/responses, potentially injecting headers or splitting requests.
- This allows modification of data in transit.
- This is a **High (H)** impact on integrity.

#### Availability (A)
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.
- The main impact is on confidentiality and integrity.
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attacker can send crafted headers over the network.                                       |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions or timing required.                                                 |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed to send crafted headers.                                             |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Vulnerability allows control beyond the vulnerable component (pivoting, SSRF, exfiltration).|
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Attacker can exfiltrate data from other requests.                                         |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Attacker can manipulate requests/responses.                                               |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability described.                                                      |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
  ≈ 3.88

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):

  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
  = 1 - 0.1936  
  = 0.8064

  Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.8064 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.8064 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.7774 - 3.25 × (0.7864)^15

  Calculate powers:

  7.52 × 0.7774 ≈ 5.85

  (0.7864)^15 ≈ 0.032 (approximate)

  3.25 × 0.032 ≈ 0.104

  Impact ≈ 5.85 - 0.104 = 5.746

- Base Score (Scope Changed):

  BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
  = Roundup (Minimum [5.746 + 3.88, 10])  
  = Roundup (9.626)  
  = 9.7

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N**

#####350#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In keyInstall, there is a possible information disclosure due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description says "local information disclosure" and "System execution privileges needed." This implies the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV = L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity. The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check, which is typically straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which means the attacker must already have high privileges (System level).  
  **PR = High (H)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is an information disclosure within the same component (keyInstall). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  "Possible information disclosure" indicates some confidentiality impact. Since it is "information disclosure," but no indication of total compromise, this is likely Low.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of impact on availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | H     | System privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Information disclosure (low impact) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 * 0.77 = 3.481  
3.481 * 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 * 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.412

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.412 + 0.799, 10))  
= round_up(2.211)  
= 2.2 → 2.2 rounds to 2.2 (CVSS scores are rounded up to one decimal place)

According to CVSS v3.1 rules, the base score is 2.2, which is considered a **Low** severity.

#####352#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An integer overflow vulnerability in Exif.cpp::jpeg_read_exif_dir in FreeImage 3.18.0 allows attackers to obtain information and cause a denial of service."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a library function that processes JPEG EXIF data.  
- Typically, image processing libraries receive data from network sources or local files.  
- Since the description does not specify local file only, and FreeImage is often used in applications that process images from network sources, we assume the attacker can supply a crafted image remotely.  
- Therefore, **Network (N)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Integer overflow vulnerabilities are usually straightforward to exploit if the attacker can supply crafted input.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply a crafted image to trigger the vulnerability.  
- No mention of needing any privileges on the system.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must get the victim to process a crafted image (e.g., open or load it).  
- This requires user interaction (e.g., opening a file).  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows information disclosure and denial of service.  
- Usually, these affect the same security scope (the application processing the image).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can obtain information (information disclosure).  
- This is typically **Low (L)** because the description does not specify full data disclosure or complete system compromise.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification or corruption of data beyond denial of service.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability can cause denial of service.  
- Denial of service is an availability impact.  
- Usually, DoS is considered **Low (L)** unless it causes complete system shutdown or permanent damage.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

| Metric               | Value  | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N      | Remote attacker can supply crafted image       |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L      | Straightforward integer overflow exploit       |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N    | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| R       | User must open/process crafted image            |
| Scope (S)            | U       | Vulnerability affects same security scope       |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L       | Information disclosure possible                   |
| Integrity (I)        | N       | No integrity impact                              |
| Availability (A)     | L       | Denial of service possible                        |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.34)  
= 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
File Upload vulnerability PMB v.7.4.8 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges via a crafted PHP file uploaded to the start_import.php file.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and uploads a crafted file via a web interface (start_import.php). This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; uploading a crafted PHP file is straightforward.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker uploads a file to the application. Usually, file upload functionality is available to authenticated users or sometimes even unauthenticated users. The description does not specify if authentication is required. However, since it mentions "remote attacker" and no mention of authentication, assume **None (N)**.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker uploads a file directly; no user interaction is required from other users.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code and privilege escalation. This suggests the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope (e.g., from application to system).  
  Therefore, **Scope = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation typically lead to full system compromise, including confidentiality impact.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation allow full integrity compromise.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Such vulnerabilities often allow denial of service or system compromise affecting availability.  
  **A = High (H)**

#####355#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Skyworth Router CM5100, version 4.1.1.24.
- Insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the DDNS Password parameter at the web interface.
- Remote attacker can supply specially crafted input via the web interface.
- Successful exploitation allows stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, which is typically straightforward to exploit.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and supplies input to the web interface.  
- Usually, web interfaces allow unauthenticated access to certain parameters like DDNS Password.  
- The description does not mention needing authentication.  
- Assume **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker performs stored XSS by injecting malicious input.  
- For stored XSS, the victim (user) must interact with the malicious content (e.g., view the page).  
- The attacker does not need user interaction, but the victim does.  
- CVSS UI metric refers to whether the attacker requires user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.  
- Here, the attacker does not require user interaction to exploit; the victim is the one interacting with the malicious content.  
- So, **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web interface and the router system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This implies a **Low** impact on confidentiality (not full system compromise).  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies a **Low** impact on integrity.  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- No indication of DoS or availability impact.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via web interface |
| AC     | L     | Simple input validation flaw |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | Attacker does not require user interaction |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible data disclosure via XSS |
| I      | L     | Possible content modification via XSS |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(6.39)  
= 6.4 (Medium severity)

#####356#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
PX4 Autopilot 1.14 and earlier, due to the lack of synchronization mechanism for loading geofence data, has a Race Condition vulnerability in the geofence.cpp and mission_feasibility_checker.cpp. This will result in the drone uploading overlapping geofences and mission routes.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Vulnerability type:** Race Condition due to lack of synchronization when loading geofence data.
- **Impact:** The drone uploads overlapping geofences and mission routes.
- **Affected component:** PX4 Autopilot software.
- **Attack vector:** The vulnerability is in software that runs on the drone. The description does not specify if the attacker needs local access or can exploit remotely.
- **Privileges:** Not explicitly stated.
- **User interaction:** Not mentioned.
- **Scope:** Not explicitly stated, but the vulnerability affects the drone's mission planning and geofence data, which could affect the drone's operation.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the autopilot software.  
- PX4 Autopilot is typically controlled remotely via network commands or mission uploads.  
- Since the vulnerability involves uploading geofences and mission routes, it is likely exploitable remotely over a network interface.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Race conditions often require precise timing but can sometimes be exploited with low complexity if the attacker can repeatedly trigger the condition.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or environment constraints.  
- Given the nature of race conditions, it is often considered **High (H)** complexity because timing must be precise.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must upload geofences and mission routes.  
- Uploading mission data usually requires some level of authentication or privileges.  
- However, the description does not specify if authentication is required.  
- Assuming the attacker must have at least low privileges to upload mission data.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by uploading data, no mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted data.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the drone's mission planning and geofence data, which could impact the drone's operation.  
- The vulnerability causes the drone to upload overlapping geofences and mission routes, potentially affecting the drone's behavior.  
- This suggests the impact crosses a security boundary within the system (from data input to operational behavior).  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes overlapping geofences and mission routes, but no mention of data disclosure.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Overlapping geofences and mission routes indicate data integrity is compromised.  
- The attacker can cause incorrect mission data to be used.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- However, incorrect mission routes could cause operational issues, potentially affecting availability.  
- Since the drone may behave incorrectly, availability impact could be Low (L).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable remotely over network |
| AC     | H     | Race condition requires precise timing |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges to upload mission data |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security scope (data to operation) |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Integrity compromised due to overlapping mission data |
| A      | L     | Potential availability impact due to incorrect operation |

#####357#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Incorrect authorization checks in GitLab CE/EE (various versions) allow a user to abuse Slack/Mattermost integrations to execute slash commands as another user.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability involves abusing integrations (Slack/Mattermost) to execute commands as another user. Since this involves network-based integrations (Slack/Mattermost are external services communicating over the network), the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
**AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
The attacker must abuse slack/mattermost integrations and exploit incorrect authorization checks. This suggests the attack is not trivial but does not require special conditions beyond having access to the integration. Since the attacker must have some access to the integration and the flaw is an authorization bypass, the complexity is likely low.  
**AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker abuses slack/mattermost integrations to execute commands as another user. The attacker must have some level of access to the integration (e.g., ability to send slash commands via Slack/Mattermost). This implies the attacker has some privileges (e.g., user-level access to the integration). Since the attacker is a user abusing the integration, but not necessarily an admin, this is likely Low privileges required.  
**PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
The attacker abuses the integration to execute commands as another user. The description does not mention that another user must perform any action (e.g., clicking a link). The attacker directly abuses the integration.  
**UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
The vulnerability allows executing commands as another user, which implies a change in privileges or impact beyond the vulnerable component. The scope is likely Changed (C) because the impact crosses security boundaries (from one user to another).  
**S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Executing commands as another user can lead to unauthorized access to data. The impact on confidentiality is likely Low or High depending on the commands executed. Since the description does not specify full data disclosure, but unauthorized command execution, we assign Low.  
**C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
Executing commands as another user can modify data or perform actions on behalf of that user, impacting integrity. This is likely High because the attacker can perform actions as another user.  
**I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
**A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: Low (L)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Changed (C)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)  

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
HashiCorp Nomad (versions 1.5.13 up to 1.6.6, and 1.7.3) template renderer is vulnerable to arbitrary file write on the host as the Nomad client user through symlink attacks. This means an attacker can write arbitrary files on the host system with the privileges of the Nomad client user.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves the template renderer in Nomad, which is a client-side component.  
- The attacker must interact with the Nomad client to exploit the vulnerability.  
- Since Nomad clients typically communicate over the network and the vulnerability is in the template renderer (likely triggered by a job or task submitted remotely), the attack can be launched remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability involves symlink attacks to write arbitrary files.  
- Symlink attacks require some conditions but are generally straightforward if the attacker can control the template or files involved.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond controlling the input.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker writes files as the Nomad client user.  
- The description says "arbitrary file write on the host as the Nomad client user," implying the attacker must have some level of access to submit or influence templates to the Nomad client.  
- Usually, submitting jobs or templates to Nomad requires some level of privileges (e.g., authenticated user or job submitter).  
- However, if the attacker can submit jobs/templates without authentication, PR would be None. If authentication is required, PR would be Low or High depending on the level.  
- Since the description does not specify that no privileges are required, and Nomad typically requires authentication to submit jobs, assume **PR = Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by submitting a job/template to the Nomad client.  
- No indication that a separate user must interact (e.g., click a link) for the exploit to succeed.  
- The attacker controls the input directly.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows writing files on the host as the Nomad client user.  
- The Nomad client user is a local user on the host, different from the Nomad server or other components.  
- The impact crosses from the Nomad application to the underlying host OS filesystem.  
- This means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary file write does not directly disclose information.  
- No direct confidentiality impact mentioned.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary file write allows modification of files on the host.  
- This is a direct integrity impact.  
- The impact is likely High because arbitrary files can be overwritten or created.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention availability impact.  
- Arbitrary file write could potentially be used to disrupt availability (e.g., overwrite system files), but this is not explicit.  
- By default, if not stated, assume no availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector (remote) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward symlink attack |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (job submission) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses from Nomad app to host OS |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Arbitrary file write impacts integrity highly |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * [ (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56 ≈ 4.21

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.69 + 4.21) = Roundup (6.90) = 6.9

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Magic-Api up to 2.0.1
- Affects an unknown functionality of the file /resource/file/api/save?auto=1
- Leads to code injection
- Attack can be launched remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack can be launched remotely"  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Most likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- Code injection vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely usually have low complexity unless otherwise stated.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Since the attack is remote and no privileges are mentioned, assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- Usually, code injection via an API endpoint does not require user interaction.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Code injection usually allows the attacker to execute code in the context of the vulnerable component.  
- If the vulnerability allows control beyond the vulnerable component's security scope (e.g., affects other components or the system), scope is **Changed (C)**.  
- Since this is code injection, likely the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Code injection can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- Since it's classified as critical and code injection, assume **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Code injection allows modification of data or code, so **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Code injection can lead to denial of service or system compromise, so **High (H)**.

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote attack possible over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions mentioned |

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One's anti-spyware engine link following.  
- Allows a **local attacker** to escalate privileges.  
- Attacker must **already have the ability to execute low-privileged code** on the target system.  

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must have local code execution first.  
- Exploitation requires local access, not network or adjacent.  
- **Value: Local (L)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or timing, just that attacker must have local code execution.  
- The requirement to have low-privileged code execution is a precondition, not an exploit complexity.  
- No indication of high complexity in the exploit itself.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must already have low-privileged code execution.  
- So, privileges required are **Low (L)** (since attacker needs low privileges, not none or high).  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required for the privilege escalation.  
- Usually, privilege escalation vulnerabilities do not require user interaction once code execution is achieved.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- Privilege escalation means the attacker gains higher privileges, potentially affecting resources beyond the initial scope.  
- This implies the **Scope is Changed (C)**.  
- **Value: Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Privilege escalation can lead to access to sensitive information.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but privilege escalation typically impacts confidentiality at least to a low degree.  
- Given the escalation, assume **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Privilege escalation allows modification of system or application data.  
- This is a direct impact on integrity.  
- Assume **High (H)** impact on integrity.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- Assume **None (N)**.  
- **Value: None (N)**

| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Some confidentiality impact due to privilege escalation                   |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | High impact on integrity due to privilege escalation                      |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                                                    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) (0.68)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)  

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.68 × 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.3432]  
= 7.52 × 0.6568 ≈ 4.94

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.52 + 4.94) = Roundup (7.46) = 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Icegram Engage.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affects: Icegram Engage WordPress plugin (versions up to 3.1.18)
- Impact: CSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions.
- Exploitation: Usually requires the victim to be authenticated and to interact with a malicious link or page.
- Attack Vector: Since this is a web plugin, the attack is likely over the network.
- Privileges Required: The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be authenticated (so the attacker exploits the victim's privileges).
- User Interaction: Required (the victim must visit a malicious page or click a link).
- Scope: Usually unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority.
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: Usually CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions, which may affect integrity and possibly availability, but rarely confidentiality.

---

### Assigning CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed over the network (web).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  CSRF attacks generally have low complexity; the attacker just needs to lure the user to a malicious page.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker does not need privileges on the system; however, the victim must be authenticated. According to CVSS guidance, if the attacker does not need privileges, PR is None.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., click a link or visit a page).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).

- **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)  
  CSRF typically does not expose confidential information.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  The attacker can cause unauthorized actions, which affects integrity to some extent.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  CSRF usually does not impact availability.

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in Atos Unify OpenScape Voice Trace Manager V8 before V8 R0.9.11. It allows authenticated path traversal in the user interface."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in the user interface, which is typically accessed over a network (e.g., web interface). Since it is a path traversal in the UI, the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Path traversal vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit if the attacker is authenticated. No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "authenticated path traversal," meaning the attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The level of privileges is not specified, but since it is "authenticated," it implies at least some privileges are required. Usually, "authenticated" means Low privileges unless otherwise specified.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is exploiting the vulnerability directly; no mention of needing another user to perform any action.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Path traversal vulnerabilities typically affect resources within the same security scope (e.g., the same application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Path traversal can allow reading arbitrary files, which can lead to information disclosure. This is at least a Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Path traversal usually does not allow modification of files, only reading. No indication of integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **A = None (N)**

|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible UI |
| AC     | L     | Simple exploitation |
| PR     | L     | Requires authentication (low privileges) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
  Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10))  
  = round_up(4.09) = 4.1

  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable web application itself (e.g., system-level code execution). This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full data disclosure.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows full modification of data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or destroy availability.  
  **Value:** High (H)

#####364#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Buffer overflow in TA for Linux and MacOS prior to 5.8.1.
- Impact: Local user can gain elevated permissions or cause Denial of Service (DoS).
- Exploitation: Through memory corruption in the TA service running as root.
- Additional impact: Disabling event reporting due to input validation failure.
- The TA service runs as root.
- The attacker is a local user.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability requires a local user to exploit it.  
- Not exploitable remotely or over network.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if no special conditions are mentioned.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is a local user, but the vulnerability allows privilege escalation.  
- The attacker must already have some privileges to exploit the vulnerability locally.  
- Since the attacker is a local user (not root), but the service runs as root, the attacker likely needs Low privileges to exploit.  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker is a local user exploiting the service directly.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation from a local user to root.  
- This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact.  
- However, privilege escalation to root implies potential full access to confidential data.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality impact = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can gain elevated permissions, which implies the ability to modify data.  
- Therefore, Integrity impact = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability can cause Denial of Service (DoS).  
- DoS impact is typically Low or High depending on severity.  
- Since it can cause DoS and disable event reporting, this is significant.  
- We'll assign Availability impact = High (H).

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: L (Local)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: L (Low)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

#####365#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in naa986 Easy Video Player allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Easy Video Player: from n/a through 1.2.2.10.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Effect:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the affected web page.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a web application vulnerability, the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network by sending crafted input to the web application.  
- **Privileges Required:** None, as anyone can submit input to the web application.  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the attack to succeed.  
- **Scope:** Usually, XSS affects the same security scope (the web application itself), so scope is Unchanged.  
- **Impact:**  
  - **Confidentiality:** Low (attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive info accessible to the browser)  
  - **Integrity:** Low (attacker can modify the content displayed to the user)  
  - **Availability:** None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**       | N     | Network - attacker can exploit remotely over the network                                  |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)**   | Low   | No special conditions required beyond sending crafted input                               |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None  | No privileges needed to perform the attack                                               |
| **User Interaction (UI)**    | Required | Victim must interact by visiting the malicious page                                     |
| **Scope (S)**                | Unchanged | The vulnerability affects resources managed by the same security authority             |
| **Confidentiality (C)**      | Low   | Attacker can access some sensitive information (e.g., cookies)                           |
| **Integrity (I)**            | Low   | Attacker can modify displayed content                                                   |
| **Availability (A)**         | None  | No impact on availability                                                               |

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 × ISC_Base  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.515 + 2.836, 10))  
= round_up(5.351)  
= 5.4

---

### Final summary:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)  
- **Base Score:** 5.4 (Medium severity)

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####366#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Twister Antivirus v8.17 is vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability by triggering the 0x801120B8 IOCTL code of the filmfd.sys driver.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type:** Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability  
- **Component:** filmfd.sys driver (a system driver)  
- **Trigger:** Sending a specific IOCTL code (0x801120B8)  
- **Affected software:** Twister Antivirus v8.17

---

### Step 2: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an IOCTL code to a driver.  
- IOCTL calls are typically made locally by processes running on the machine, not remotely over a network.  
- Therefore, the attacker must have local access to the system to send the IOCTL request.  
- **AV = Local (L)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific IOCTL code.  
- If the IOCTL code is known and can be triggered reliably without special conditions, AC is Low.  
- If it requires special conditions or timing, AC is High.  
- Since the description does not mention any special conditions or complexity, assume **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To send IOCTL requests to a driver, typically administrative or elevated privileges are required.  
- However, some drivers allow IOCTL calls from unprivileged users.  
- The description does not specify if privileges are required.  
- Given it's a driver IOCTL, assume **PR = High (H)** (conservative assumption)  
- If the driver is accessible to unprivileged users, PR would be None or Low, but no info suggests that.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an IOCTL code, which is a direct action by the attacker.  
- No user interaction is required.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a kernel driver (filmfd.sys).  
- Out-of-bounds read could lead to information disclosure or system instability.  
- If the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., kernel memory), scope is Changed (C).  
- Out-of-bounds read in a driver usually affects kernel memory, so scope is likely Changed.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure.  
- The impact is likely Low or High depending on the data exposed.  
- Since it's an out-of-bounds read, assume **Confidentiality = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Out-of-bounds read does not modify data.  
- **Integrity = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Out-of-bounds read may cause crashes or instability, but not guaranteed.  
- If it can cause denial of service, Availability impact is Low or High.  
- Since the description does not mention crashes or DoS, assume **Availability = None (N)**

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local access required to send IOCTL                                      |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions mentioned                                          |

| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                             |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Kernel memory affected, scope changed                                    |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:H (0.27 with Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Explaining PR value:**  
- For Scope Changed, PR:H = 0.27

---

**Calculate Impact Subscore (ISC):**

ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 1 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

---

**Calculate Impact:**

Impact = 7.52 * (ISC - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.22 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.22 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.191 - 3.25 * (0.2)^15  
= 1.43632 - 3.25 * (3.2768e-11)  
≈ 1.43632 - 1.064e-10  
≈ 1.4363

---

**Calculate Exploitability:**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.2295  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.1767  
= 8.22 * 0.0972  
= 0.799

---

**Calculate Base Score:**

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (1.4363 + 0.799), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 2.2353, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.413, 10))  
= 2.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

---

### Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 2.5 (Low)

---

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

#####367#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
kodbox v1.49.04 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the URL parameter.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Attack Vector:** Via URL parameter, so attacker can exploit remotely over the network.  
- **Attack Complexity:** Usually XSS vulnerabilities are straightforward to exploit if the URL parameter is not sanitized properly, so likely Low.  
- **Privileges Required:** None, since the attacker just needs to send a crafted URL.  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must click or visit the malicious URL for the XSS to execute.  
- **Scope:** Usually XSS affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application), so Unchanged.  
- **Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: XSS can steal cookies or sensitive info, so Low impact.  
  - Integrity: XSS can modify displayed content, so Low impact.  
  - Availability: Usually no impact on availability, so None.

---

### Step 2: Assign metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable over the network via URL parameter                                            |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed, straightforward exploitation                                |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  | No privileges required to exploit                                                        |
| User Interaction (UI) | R     | User must click or visit the malicious URL                                               |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web app)                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible disclosure of sensitive info via XSS                                            |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of displayed content                                               |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                |

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.52 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.20) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place: 5.2

---

### Final summary:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)  
- Base Score: 5.2 (Medium severity)

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####368#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in specific Rockwell Automation ControlLogix and GuardLogix controllers. If exploited, the product could potentially experience a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF). The device will restart itself to recover from the MNRF.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability affects controllers, which are typically network-connected industrial devices.  
- Since the description does not specify physical access or adjacency, and these controllers are often accessed over a network, the most reasonable assumption is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit.  
- Denial-of-service vulnerabilities in networked devices are often straightforward to exploit.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges to exploit.  
- Usually, DoS vulnerabilities in networked devices can be exploited without authentication.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.  
- The attacker can likely trigger the fault remotely without user involvement.  
- Hence, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes the device to restart itself.  
- This is a denial-of-service affecting the same component (the controller).  
- No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability is a denial-of-service, no mention of data disclosure.  
- **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The device experiences a major nonrecoverable fault and restarts.  
- This causes a denial-of-service, impacting availability significantly.  
- The description says "major nonrecoverable fault" and device restart, which is a high impact on availability.  
- So, **High (H)**.

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: None (N)  
- A: High (H)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.47)  
= 7.5

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####369#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in TRENDnet TEW-815DAP 1.0.2.0
- Affects function do_setNTP in POST Request Handler
- Manipulation of NtpDstStart/NtpDstEnd arguments leads to command injection
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely, and it involves a POST request handler (likely over the network).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a command injection via manipulation of POST parameters.  
- No special conditions or environment needed are mentioned.  
- Hence, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can send a POST request to the device to exploit the vulnerability.  
- No mention of needing any privileges or authentication.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker initiates the attack remotely; no user interaction is required.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to command injection, which likely allows control over the device beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Command injection typically affects the system beyond the vulnerable component, so Scope is Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- So, Confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Command injection allows arbitrary command execution, so integrity is fully compromised.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Command injection can disrupt or disable the device, causing denial of service.  
- Availability impact is High (H).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85 ≈ 3.97

2. Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 × 0.915 ≈ 6.88

3. Base Score (Scope Changed):  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 3.97, 10])  
= Roundup (10.85, 10) = 10.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"IBM Security Verify Access 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.6.1 uses insecure protocols in some instances that could allow an attacker on the network to take control of the server."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is "on the network" and can exploit insecure protocols. This implies the attack can be launched remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description states "insecure protocols" that "could allow an attacker... to take control." No mention of special conditions or complexity. Usually, insecure protocols imply low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "on the network" and can take control of the server, implying no prior privileges are needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The attacker can "take control of the server," which suggests impact beyond the vulnerable component itself. This implies the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Taking control of the server implies a high confidentiality impact (full access to data).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Taking control of the server implies the attacker can modify data or system state.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Taking control of the server also implies the attacker can disrupt or deny service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  |

#####371#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Dell EMC AppSync versions 4.2.0.0 to 4.6.0.0 (including all Service Packs)
- Vulnerability: Exposure of sensitive information in server logs
- Impact: Disclosure of certain user credentials
- Attacker: High privileged remote attacker
- Result: Attacker may use exposed credentials to access the system with the privileges of the compromised account

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit.  
- However, the attacker must be "high privileged" already, which is a precondition, but that does not affect AC.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is described as "high privileged remote attacker."  
- This means the attacker must already have high privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.  
- PR = High (H)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required for the exploit.  
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to disclosure of credentials and then attacker uses those credentials to access the system with the compromised account's privileges.  
- The initial vulnerability is in AppSync server logs, and the attacker already has high privileges on the system.  
- The impact is on the same system (no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component).  
- Therefore, Scope is Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- There is disclosure of sensitive information (user credentials).  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.  
- C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability itself does not directly modify data or system integrity.  
- However, the attacker can use the credentials to access the system with the compromised account's privileges, potentially modifying data.  
- But the CVSS base metrics consider the direct impact of the vulnerability, not the subsequent actions by the attacker.  
- Since the vulnerability is an information disclosure, not a direct integrity modification, I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of impact on availability.  
- A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attacker |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | H     | Attacker must have high privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same scope |
| C      | H     | Disclosure of sensitive credentials |
| I      | N     | No direct integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 for Scope Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 1 × 1) = 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.59 + 1.23) = Round_up (4.82) = 4.8

#####372#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) version 1.0
- Vulnerable parameter: grndate in /cupseasylive/grnmodify.php
- Impact: Remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user and steal session cookie credentials.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a URL with malicious input.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond sending the URL.  
- This is a typical XSS scenario with low complexity.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker targets an authenticated user, meaning the victim must be logged in.  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must have privileges (authenticated user).  
- For CVSS, PR refers to the attacker’s privileges on the vulnerable component.  
- Since the attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system (they just send a URL), PR is None.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the user to click or visit the specially crafted URL.  
- This means user interaction is required.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stealing session cookies, which affects the user’s session but does not escalate privileges or affect other components beyond the vulnerable web application.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session cookie credentials, which is a confidentiality breach.  
- This is a high confidentiality impact because session cookies can lead to account takeover.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention modification of data or integrity impact.  
- XSS typically does not directly modify data on the server.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **Value: None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: N (None)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(6.4252)  
= 6.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
There is a command injection vulnerability in the ssdpcgi_main function of cgibin binary in D-Link DIR-815 router firmware v1.04.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a CGI binary function (ssdpcgi_main), which is typically accessible via network requests (HTTP). Since it's a router firmware and the vulnerability is in a CGI script, it is very likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Command injection vulnerabilities in CGI scripts usually require no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. No mention of special conditions or timing.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since this is a command injection in a CGI script, it is likely exploitable without authentication or privileges. The description does not mention needing credentials.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends crafted requests directly to the CGI script. No user interaction is needed.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Command injection in a CGI script usually allows the attacker to execute commands on the underlying system, potentially affecting components beyond the vulnerable component itself. This means the scope is likely changed.  
  **S = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including reading sensitive data. So confidentiality impact is High.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Command injection allows arbitrary command execution, so integrity is fully compromised.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., by deleting files, stopping services).  
  **A = High (H)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses privilege boundaries (system level) |
| C      | H     | Full confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Full integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Full availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Sub-Score (for Scope Changed):**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
= 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
= 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else if Scope Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (6.20 + 4.37), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 10.57, 10))  
= round_up(min(11.41, 10))  
= round_up(10) = 10.0

#####374#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- **Product:** Moby (Docker-related)
- **Vulnerability:** Cache poisoning in the classic builder cache system when building images FROM scratch.
- **Attack scenario:** An attacker who knows the victim's Dockerfile can poison the cache by making the victim pull a specially crafted image.
- **Affected users:** Those using classic builder cache (opted out of Buildkit or using /build API endpoint).
- **Impact:** Cache poisoning could cause incorrect build cache hits, potentially leading to incorrect or malicious build results.
- **Attack vector:** Requires the attacker to make the victim pull a specially crafted image.
- **Privileges:** No mention of needing privileges on the victim system; attacker needs to control or supply a crafted image.
- **User interaction:** The victim must pull the image or build the image using the vulnerable builder.
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the build cache system, which is part of the same software environment.
- **Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability:** The description implies integrity impact (poisoned cache leads to incorrect builds), possibly availability or confidentiality impact is not clearly stated.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely by making the victim pull a crafted image.  
- Pulling an image is a network operation.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs knowledge of the victim's Dockerfile and must craft a special image accordingly.  
- This requires some conditions and knowledge, but no advanced or unpredictable conditions.  
- The complexity is somewhat higher than trivial but not very high.  
- According to CVSS guidelines, requiring knowledge of victim's Dockerfile is moderate complexity.  
- **AC = Low (L)** (since the attacker only needs to know the Dockerfile, which might be public or guessable)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the victim system; they only need to supply a crafted image.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must pull the image or build the image using the vulnerable builder.  
- This is user-initiated action (pull/build).  
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the build cache system within the same security scope (the same software environment).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality breach.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Cache poisoning can cause incorrect build results, which is an integrity impact.  
- The impact is likely partial, not complete system compromise.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector (pulling image) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, attacker needs Dockerfile knowledge |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must pull/build image |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (cache poisoning) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(4.24)  
= 4.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####375#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WP Lab WP-Lister Lite for eBay allows Reflected XSS. This issue affects WP-Lister Lite for eBay: from n/a through 3.5.7.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and impact

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Attack Vector:** Typically, reflected XSS can be exploited remotely over the network by sending a crafted URL or request.
- **Attack Complexity:** Usually low for reflected XSS because the attacker just needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
- **Privileges Required:** None, as the attacker does not need any privileges on the system.
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must click or interact with the malicious link.
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).
- **Confidentiality:** Low impact, as XSS can leak some information but not full system data.
- **Integrity:** Low impact, as XSS can modify displayed content or execute scripts but not directly modify backend data.
- **Availability:** None or low, as XSS typically does not affect availability.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network          |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Easy to exploit with crafted URL                |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Totolink N350RT 9.3.5u.6139_B20201216
- Affects the function main in /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi?action=login (HTTP POST Request Handler)
- Manipulation of argument v8 leads to stack-based buffer overflow
- Attack can be launched remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Vendor did not respond

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is launched remotely via HTTP POST request.
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.
- No special conditions or environment needed are mentioned.
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and presumably straightforward.
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the login CGI script.
- No mention of needing any privileges before the attack.
- Likely no privileges required.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends a request directly to the vulnerable component.
- No user interaction required.
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is in the HTTP POST request handler of the device.
- Stack-based buffer overflow likely leads to code execution or crash within the same component.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.
- Usually, buffer overflow in a network service on an embedded device changes the scope because it can lead to code execution beyond the initial component.
- However, since the vulnerable component is part of the device's firmware, and exploitation likely leads to control over the device, the scope is **Changed (C)**.
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution.
- This can allow reading sensitive information.
- So confidentiality impact is **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- Code execution allows modification of data.
- Integrity impact is **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**

- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.
- Availability impact is **High (H)**.

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via HTTP POST |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Exploit leads to control beyond initial component |
| C      | H     | Full confidentiality impact possible |
| I      | H     | Full integrity impact possible |
| A      | H     | Full availability impact possible |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):

Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 × 0.915  
= 6.88

- Base Score (Scope Changed):

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 3.88, 10])  
= Roundup (10.76, 10)  
= 10.0

- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####378#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin for WordPress, versions up to 6.2.4
- Attack vector: Injection of scripts via a custom text field
- Attacker: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above
- Impact: Arbitrary script execution when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by submitting data through a web interface (custom text field).  
- The attacker must be authenticated and have contributor-level access, so the attack is not purely remote without authentication.  
- However, the attacker can perform the attack remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Since the attacker must be authenticated but can perform the attack remotely, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, which is a straightforward injection.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor-level access or above.  
- Contributor-level access is a low privilege level in WordPress (not admin, but can create and edit content).  
- So, **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires a user to access the injected page for the script to execute.  
- So, user interaction is required.  
- **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the WordPress application).  
- The impact is on the application itself, no privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim user.  
- Typically, XSS leads to low confidentiality impact unless it allows full data disclosure.  
- Here, the description does not mention direct data leakage, only script execution.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This can be considered a low integrity impact because the attacker can cause unauthorized changes via the victim's session.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Noah Kagan Scroll Triggered Box allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Scroll Triggered Box: from n/a through 2.3."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Effect:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed in the context of other users visiting the affected web page.  
- **Impact:** Typically affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the user's session or data accessible via the browser.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely over the network (via web requests).  
   - **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit stored XSS.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - The victim must visit the maliciously crafted page or content for the script to execute.  
   - **Value:** Required (R)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application).  
   - No privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component.  
   - **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
   - Usually considered **Low** impact because it depends on what data is accessible.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - The attacker can modify or inject content seen by users, affecting integrity.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - XSS typically does not affect availability directly.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

---

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####380#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Huaxia ERP up to version 3.1.
- Affects an unknown function in UserController.java.
- The issue leads to weak password recovery.
- The attack can be launched remotely.
- Upgrade to version 3.2 fixes the issue.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Weak password recovery suggests a straightforward attack.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attack is related to password recovery, which typically does not require prior privileges.  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges to exploit this.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention the need for user interaction.  
- Password recovery is usually a user-initiated process, but the vulnerability is about weak recovery mechanism, which can be exploited remotely without user interaction.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the UserController component, likely within the same security scope (same application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Weak password recovery can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (passwords or reset tokens).  
- This suggests some loss of confidentiality, but not necessarily total compromise.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Weak password recovery could allow an attacker to reset or change passwords, affecting integrity.  
- This suggests some loss of integrity.  
- Therefore, Integrity = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.40) = 6.4

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **6.4**.

#####381#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Bref enables serverless PHP on AWS Lambda.
- When used with Event-Driven Function runtime and a `RequestHandlerInterface` handler, the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object.
- During conversion, if the request is MultiPart, each part is parsed and added to `$files` or `$parsedBody`.
- The conversion produces different output compared to plain PHP when keys end with an open square bracket `[`.
- This difference in body parsing might lead to vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors.
- Patched in version 2.1.13.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability occurs during the processing of a Lambda event, which is triggered remotely (e.g., via HTTP or event triggers).  
- The attack is likely to be exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., sending a specially crafted MultiPart request).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability depends on a specific condition: the request must be MultiPart and contain keys ending with `[`.  
- This is a somewhat specific condition but not very complex to achieve for an attacker who controls the request.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to send a specially crafted request to the Lambda function.  
- No privileges on the system or function are required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends the request directly to the Lambda function.  
- No user interaction is required for the exploit.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the Lambda function's internal processing of the request.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the function's own scope (e.g., AWS infrastructure or other functions).  
- The impact is limited to the function's own environment.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions "vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors" due to parsing differences.  
- It does not explicitly mention data disclosure or information leak.  
- However, malformed parsing could lead to some data exposure or leakage depending on application logic.  
- Given the uncertainty, assign **Low (L)** to reflect potential limited confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability could lead to undefined behaviors or vulnerabilities based on application logic.  
- This suggests possible modification or injection of data in `$files` or `$parsedBody`.  
- Assign **Low (L)** to reflect potential limited integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- No explicit mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- Undefined behaviors might cause crashes or instability, but this is not clearly stated.  
- Assign **None (N)** as no clear availability impact is described.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged) = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.40)  
= 6.4 → 6.4 rounds to 6.4 (CVSS scores are rounded to one decimal place)

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####382#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Origin validation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One security agent.
- Impact: Could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges.
- Exploitation prerequisite: Attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- Attack vector: Local (since attacker must already have code execution on the system).
- Privileges required: Low (attacker must have low-privileged code execution).
- User interaction: Not mentioned, so assume none required.
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but privilege escalation usually changes scope (from low privilege to higher privilege).
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability: Privilege escalation typically impacts integrity and possibly confidentiality and availability, but the description only mentions privilege escalation, so assume at least integrity impact is high. Confidentiality and availability are not explicitly mentioned, so assume none or low.

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must have local code execution.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: No special conditions or complexity mentioned beyond having low-privileged code execution.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must have low-privileged code execution.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  Reason: No user interaction mentioned.

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation implies the attacker gains higher privileges, changing the scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)  
  Reason: No mention of confidentiality impact.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation impacts integrity significantly.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  Reason: No mention of availability impact.

### Summary of metric values:

- AV:L  
- AC:L  
- PR:L  
- UI:N  
- S:C  
- C:N  
- I:H  
- A:N

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56 ≈ 4.21

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (4.21 + 2.52), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 6.73, 10))  
= round_up(7.27) = 7.3

#####383#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in openBI up to 6.0.3, specifically in the function addxinzhi in User.php (Phar Handler component).
- The vulnerability is due to manipulation of the argument "outimgurl" leading to deserialization.
- The attack can be launched remotely.
- The vulnerability is classified as critical.
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability involves deserialization via manipulation of an argument.  
- No mention of special conditions or environment constraints.  
- Usually, deserialization vulnerabilities with direct argument manipulation are low complexity.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges.  
- The attack is remotely exploitable via an argument.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely without user involvement.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a component of the application (Phar Handler in User.php).  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities often lead to code execution or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The description says "critical" and "may be used" but does not explicitly say if the scope changes.  
- However, deserialization vulnerabilities often lead to privilege escalation or impact outside the vulnerable component, so scope is likely Changed (C).  
- Therefore, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution or data disclosure.  
- Since it is classified as critical, it likely impacts confidentiality significantly.  
- Let's assume High (H) confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Deserialization can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of data.  
- Therefore, High (H) integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities can cause denial of service or system crash.  
- Given the critical classification, assume High (H) availability impact.

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attack possible                                                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                            |

| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                              |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Impact beyond vulnerable component (likely code execution)                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Critical impact on confidentiality                                        |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Critical impact on integrity                                              |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact = 7.52 * (ISC - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
  = 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
  = 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

- Base Score =  
  If Impact <= 0, then 0, else:  
  If Scope Changed:  
  BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 * (6.20 + 3.97), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 * 10.17, 10))  
  = round_up(min(10.99, 10))  
  = 10.0

#####384#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The Popup Builder WordPress plugin before 4.2.3 does not prevent simple visitors from updating existing popups, and injecting raw JavaScript in them, which could lead to Stored XSS attacks.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact:** Injection of arbitrary JavaScript code, which can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts on users of the website.
- **Who can exploit:** "Simple visitors" can update existing popups and inject JavaScript.
- **Attack Vector:** Since visitors can exploit this remotely via the web interface, the attack vector is Network.
- **Privileges Required:** None, since "simple visitors" (unauthenticated or minimal privileges) can perform the attack.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker injects the script, but for the XSS to have impact, a user must view the popup (victim user). So user interaction is required.
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the web application itself, but the impact is on the users of the application (confidentiality, integrity, availability of users' data or session). Stored XSS typically affects other users, not the application itself. This means the scope is Changed.
- **Confidentiality:** High, because arbitrary JavaScript can steal cookies, tokens, or other sensitive data.
- **Integrity:** High, because arbitrary JavaScript can modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.
- **Availability:** Low or High? XSS can be used to perform DoS or disrupt availability, but usually the impact is less severe than confidentiality/integrity. Let's assign Low.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**       | N     | Exploitable over the network (web).                                                        |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)**   | L     | No special conditions; "simple visitors" can exploit it.                                  |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | N     | No privileges required; any visitor can exploit.                                          |
| **User Interaction (UI)**    | R     | Victim user must view the malicious popup for the XSS to execute.                         |
| **Scope (S)**                | C     | Vulnerability in the web app affects other users, so scope is changed.                    |
| **Confidentiality (C)**      | H     | Arbitrary JavaScript can steal sensitive data.                                            |
| **Integrity (I)**            | H     | Arbitrary JavaScript can modify content or perform actions.                               |
| **Availability (A)**         | L     | Possible disruption but less likely severe DoS.                                           |

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (for Scope Changed)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.78]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 = 0.1936; 0.1936 × 0.78 = 0.151]  
= 1 - 0.151 = 0.849

Since Scope is Changed:

Impact Subscore = 7.52 × (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.849 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.849 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.82 - 3.25 × (0.829)^15

Calculate powers:

7.52 × 0.82 = 6.1664

(0.829)^15 ≈ 0.042 (approximate)

3.25 × 0.042 = 0.1365

Impact Subscore = 6.1664 - 0.1365 = 6.03

**Base Score:**

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0, else:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.03 + 2.836, 10])  
= Roundup (8.866) = 8.9

#####385#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in DedeBIZ 6.3.0
- Critical severity
- Affects `/admin/makehtml_freelist_action.php`
- SQL Injection via manipulation of the argument `startid`
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed
- Vendor did not respond

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- SQL Injection typically occurs over the network (e.g., via HTTP request).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection via argument manipulation is usually straightforward if no additional conditions are required.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument in a web request.  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request; no user interaction is needed.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web application component.  
- SQL Injection typically affects the same security scope (the web app and its database).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since the vulnerability is classified as critical and is a SQL Injection, it likely leads to significant data exposure.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Therefore, Integrity = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but no explicit mention here.  
- However, critical SQL Injection often impacts availability as well.  
- To be conservative and consistent with critical SQL Injection, assign High (H).  
- Alternatively, if no explicit mention, Low (L) or None (N) could be considered.  
- Given the critical classification and typical impact, assign High (H).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score (Optional)

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Impact + Exploitability**  
= 5.88 + 4.37 = 10.25

Since the maximum base score is 10, the final base score is 10.0 (critical).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Kashipara Food Management System up to 1.0.
- Affects party_details.php.
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the argument party_name.
- The attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- XSS is typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via a web request).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS usually requires only sending a crafted input, no special conditions.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument (party_name) remotely.  
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS requires the victim to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a crafted URL or view a page).  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user or session hijacking.  
- Usually considered Low impact on confidentiality because it can expose user data or cookies.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a Low impact on integrity (modification of data or actions).  
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: L (Low)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore (Confidentiality + Integrity + Availability):**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.68) = round_up(5.19) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **5.2**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WP Smart Editor JoomUnited allows Reflected XSS. This issue affects JoomUnited: from n/a through 1.3.3."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, reflected XSS is exploitable over the network (via HTTP requests).  
- **Privileges Required:** None, since the attacker just needs to send a crafted request.  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must click a malicious link or visit a crafted URL.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Impact:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal some data accessible to the user)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify data in the user's session or perform actions as the user)  
  - Availability: None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  No privileges are needed to exploit.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., click a link).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Some data accessible to the user can be exposed.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  The attacker can modify data or perform actions as the user.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No impact on availability.

| Scope (S)            | U     | Same security scope                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial data disclosure possible                 |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Partial modification possible                     |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact                           |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.84) = Roundup(5.35) = 5.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Input Validation in Hitron Systems DVR HVR-16781 1.03~4.02 allows an attacker to cause network attack in case of using default admin ID/PW."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Improper Input Validation**: This suggests some form of input is not properly checked, potentially leading to exploitation.
- **Allows an attacker to cause network attack**: The attacker can exploit this over the network.
- **In case of using default admin ID/PW**: The attacker must authenticate using default credentials.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is possible over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack requires the use of default admin credentials, which is a known weakness but not complex to exploit if those credentials are unchanged. This is generally considered low complexity because no special conditions beyond default credentials are needed.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must authenticate with default admin credentials. Admin credentials imply **High** privileges. However, CVSS defines PR as:  
  - None (N): No privileges required  
  - Low (L): Basic user privileges  
  - High (H): Administrative privileges  
  Since the attacker must use admin credentials, **High (H)** is appropriate.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the device itself). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description says "allows an attacker to cause network attack," but does not explicitly mention data disclosure. However, since the attacker has admin access, they likely can access confidential information. Given the default admin credentials are used, and the attacker can cause an attack, it's reasonable to assume at least **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  With admin access, the attacker can likely modify system settings or data. So, **Low (L)** or **High (H)**? The description is vague, but "cause network attack" implies some control or modification. Given admin access, **High (H)** is reasonable.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description says "cause network attack," which could imply denial of service or disruption. Given admin access, the attacker can likely disrupt availability. So, **High (H)**.  
  **Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, just default creds |
| PR     | H     | Requires admin privileges (default admin ID/PW) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact likely |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to admin access |
| A      | H     | High availability impact possible |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.151]  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(6.68) = 6.7

#####389#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Scripting in FireEye HXTool affecting version 4.6. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store a specially crafted JavaScript payload in the 'Profile Name' and 'Hostname/IP' parameters that will be triggered when items are loaded.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves storing a malicious script in input fields ('Profile Name' and 'Hostname/IP').  
- The attacker must be able to submit these parameters, likely through a network request (e.g., web interface).  
- Since the attack can be performed remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests), AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a JavaScript payload and store it in input fields.  
- No special conditions or timing are mentioned; this is a typical stored XSS scenario.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to submit data to the application.  
- Usually, stored XSS in web apps can be exploited by unauthenticated users if the input fields are accessible without authentication.  
- The description does not specify that authentication is required.  
- Assume PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The payload is triggered when items are loaded, meaning a user must load the page or items for the script to execute.  
- So, user interaction is required for the exploit to have an effect.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS affecting the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This implies a potential confidentiality impact.  
- Usually, this is considered Low (L) because the attacker can steal some data but not necessarily full system compromise.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via web interface |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to submit payload |
| UI     | R     | User must load the page to trigger payload |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, same security authority |
| C      | L     | Confidentiality impact due to data theft |
| I      | L     | Integrity impact due to script execution |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

  The attack is performed via a crafted GET request, which is over the network (HTTP request).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection via a GET parameter usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted GET request, implying no authentication or privileges are needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker directly sends the request; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary SQL commands on the database, which is part of the same security authority as the web application. The impact is within the same scope (no privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure. The description says "run arbitrary SQL commands," which can include reading sensitive data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary SQL commands can modify or delete data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary SQL commands can also delete or corrupt data, or cause denial of service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
  = 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

- Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
  = round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
  = round_up(9.77) = 9.8

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(6.42) = 6.4 → 6.4 rounds to 6.4 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely via network DHCPv6 message                                           |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed                                                              |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to send DHCPv6 message                                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction needed                                                                |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact confined to the vulnerable component                                               |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Potential total loss of confidentiality                                                   |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.476 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 ≈ 0.915

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(9.79) = 9.8

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####393#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in HOME SPOT CUBE2 V102 and earlier. By processing invalid values, arbitrary code may be executed. Note that the affected products are no longer supported.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow triggered by processing invalid values. Since it involves processing input values, it is likely exploitable remotely over a network (e.g., via network packets or remote input). No indication that physical or local access is required.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Buffer overflows triggered by invalid values are typically straightforward to exploit.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges. Since arbitrary code execution is possible by processing invalid values, it suggests no privileges are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention that user interaction is required. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending invalid values.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which likely affects the same security scope (the vulnerable software). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is High.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data and system state.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the system.  
  **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable remotely over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | H     | Arbitrary code execution leads to full confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Arbitrary code execution leads to full integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Arbitrary code execution leads to full availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.36

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 4.36, 10))  
= round_up(10.24) → 10.0 (max score is 10)

#####394#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress, versions ≤ 9.1.0
- Attack vector: Injection via shortcode attribute 'header_tag'
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
- Impact: Injection of arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely by submitting crafted shortcode attributes.  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests to WordPress).  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to unrestricted use of an attribute, which suggests no special conditions or timing are required.  
- The attacker only needs to inject the payload via shortcode attribute.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor-level is a low privilege but not none.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, contributor-level corresponds to Low privileges.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires a user to access the injected page for the script to execute.  
- The attacker injects the script, but the victim user must view the page for the payload to run.  
**Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin environment).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The impact is on the same scope (plugin/page).  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to data theft or session hijacking, but the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
- However, stored XSS typically allows at least some confidentiality impact (e.g., stealing cookies or data accessible to the user).  
- Assign Low (L) for confidentiality impact.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- Assign Low (L) for integrity.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact (e.g., denial of service).  
- Assign None (N).  
**Value:** None (N)

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires contributor-level or above permissions (low privileges)                          |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must view the injected page for script execution                                    |

| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible content/script modification                                                    |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact reported                                                         |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Round_up (4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####395#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability: NULL Pointer Dereference in Linux kernel (net, bluetooth modules)
- Affects: Linux kernel v2.6.12-rc2 on x86, ARM
- Impact: Overflow Buffers (likely causing crashes or denial of service)
- Location: /net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.C
- No explicit mention of privilege escalation or user interaction
- The vulnerability is in kernel modules related to networking and Bluetooth

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in kernel modules related to networking and Bluetooth.  
- Since it involves network and Bluetooth modules, the attacker can likely exploit it remotely over the network or via Bluetooth.  
- Bluetooth is considered Adjacent (A) because it requires proximity, not remote over the internet.  
- Network (N) is for attacks over the internet or broader network.  
- Given Bluetooth is mentioned explicitly, and Bluetooth is considered Adjacent, AV = A.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complex steps to exploit.  
- NULL pointer dereference is usually straightforward to trigger once access is gained.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in kernel modules.  
- Usually, to trigger kernel module vulnerabilities, some level of privileges is required (e.g., local user or system user).  
- No explicit mention of privilege escalation or that no privileges are required.  
- Since it is a kernel vulnerability, but no mention of remote exploitation without privileges, assume Low (L) privileges required (e.g., local user).  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- Kernel vulnerabilities typically do not require user interaction once the attacker has access.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel, and a NULL pointer dereference causing buffer overflow likely affects kernel memory.  
- This can affect the kernel's integrity and availability, but does it affect other components beyond the kernel?  
- Since the kernel is the security boundary, and the impact is within the kernel, Scope is likely Unchanged (U).  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- NULL pointer dereference and buffer overflow in kernel modules usually cause crashes or denial of service, not data leakage.  
- No mention of data disclosure.  
- C = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or code execution.  
- NULL pointer dereference usually causes crashes, not integrity loss.  
- I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow and NULL pointer dereference in kernel modules can cause system crashes or denial of service.  
- So, availability is impacted.  
- Severity likely Low or High depending on impact.  
- Since it is a kernel crash, availability impact is High (H).

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Bluetooth modules imply Adjacent network attack vector |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (local user) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to kernel, no scope change |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Kernel crash causes high availability impact |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [for Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.44) = 6 × 0.56 = 3.36

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.36 + 2.05, 10)) = round_up(5.41) = 5.4

- SQL injection can allow modification of data.  
- The description implies the attacker can forge SQL injection, which can modify data.  
- At least Low impact on integrity.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via HTTP |
| AC     | L     | Trivial HTTP call, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | Guest user, no privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | L     | Sensitive data exposure possible |
| I      | L     | Possible data modification |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
≈ 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.51 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (6.40)  
= 6.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
OpenVPN Connect version 3.0 through 3.4.6 on macOS allows local users to execute code in external third party libraries using the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires a local user to exploit it. It is not exploitable remotely or over the network.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description suggests that a local user can execute code by setting an environment variable (DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES). This is a straightforward action and does not require special conditions or timing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be a local user, but the description does not specify that elevated privileges are required. It implies a normal local user can exploit it.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention that another user must perform any action for the exploit to succeed. The local user can execute code by setting the environment variable themselves.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows code execution in external third party libraries, which likely affects the same security authority (the OpenVPN process). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution can lead to full access to the process, so confidentiality is likely fully compromised.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows modification of data and code, so integrity is fully compromised.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can also lead to denial of service or disruption of service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

#####398#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An OS command injection vulnerability has been reported to affect QuMagie. If exploited, the vulnerability could allow authenticated users to execute commands via a network."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited "via a network."  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; command injection typically requires low complexity if authentication is present.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "authenticated users," so some privileges are required but not high-level.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that user interaction is required for exploitation. The attacker is authenticated and can execute commands via network.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of OS commands, which likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., system-level commands). This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  OS command injection can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. The impact is likely high because arbitrary commands can be executed.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can modify or delete data, so integrity is highly impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Command execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., by stopping services).  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Construct the CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####399#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
Sysmac Studio installs executables in a directory with poor permissions. This can allow a locally-authenticated attacker to overwrite files which will result in code execution with privileges of a different user.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must be local (locally-authenticated) to overwrite files. So, the attack is performed on the local system.  
  **AV:L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description implies that the attacker can overwrite files due to poor permissions, which is a straightforward action once local access is obtained. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "locally-authenticated," so some privileges are required to access the system. However, the attacker can overwrite files to escalate privileges to a different user. The description does not specify if the attacker needs low or high privileges initially, but since it says "locally-authenticated attacker," it implies at least some privileges but not necessarily high.  
  Given that the attacker can overwrite executables due to poor permissions, it is likely that the attacker has low privileges (e.g., a standard user).  
  **PR:L (Low)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any need for user interaction (e.g., tricking a user to open a file). The attacker acts locally and overwrites files directly.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The attacker overwrites executables to achieve code execution with privileges of a different user. This implies that the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the attacker's initial scope.  
  Therefore, the scope is changed.  
  **S:C (Changed)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution with privileges of a different user can lead to full access to that user's data, which is a high confidentiality impact.  
  **C:H (High)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Overwriting executables and executing code with different privileges is a complete compromise of integrity.  
  **I:H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability. The main impact is code execution and privilege escalation.  
  **A:N (None)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to exploit |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (locally authenticated) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to privilege escalation |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.68 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.246  
≈ 2.02

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 1)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.1936)  
= 7.52 × 0.8064  
≈ 6.06

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Round up to one decimal place of:  
If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
Else:  
Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.06 + 2.02, 10])  
= Roundup (8.08)  
= 8.1

---

### Metric Analysis:

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via HTTP requests over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####401#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) has a vulnerability in `CefLayeredWindowUpdaterOSR::OnAllocatedSharedMemory` where it does not check the size of the shared memory, leading to an out-of-bounds read outside the sandbox.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves shared memory handling in a framework embedding Chromium browsers.  
- Since this is about shared memory and out-of-bounds read, it likely requires local access to the system or application.  
- It is not described as remotely exploitable over a network.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)** is the most appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is an out-of-bounds read due to missing size check.  
- This is a straightforward programming error, no special conditions or race conditions mentioned.  
- So, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- However, since it involves shared memory and embedding in applications, the attacker likely needs to run code or interact with the application locally.  
- Usually, local code execution or interaction implies at least low privileges.  
- But since it is a framework embedded in other apps, and the vulnerability is in the framework itself, it might be exploitable by an unprivileged user running the application.  
- Given the lack of explicit mention, assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required to trigger the vulnerability.  
- The vulnerability is a memory handling bug that can be triggered by the application itself or attacker-controlled input.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds read outside the sandbox.  
- This suggests that the impact crosses security boundaries (sandbox to outside).  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description implies reading memory outside intended bounds, which can leak sensitive data.  
- So, **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, no mention of modifying data.  
- So, **None (N)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or crashing the system.  
- Out-of-bounds read may cause crashes, but not explicitly stated.  
- Assume **None (N)** availability impact.

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward missing size check, no special conditions.                                |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Likely requires low privileges to interact with the application/framework.                |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Out-of-bounds read outside sandbox changes scope.                                         |

  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the script. This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can inject arbitrary script or HTML, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user. This is a partial loss of integrity.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Base Score calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.82

2. Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

3. Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

4. Base Score = Impact + Exploitability  
= 2.51 + 2.82 = 5.33

Since Scope is Unchanged, no further adjustment.

Round up to one decimal place: **5.4**

- The impact is primarily on confidentiality (unauthorized data access).
- No explicit mention of integrity or availability impact.

---

### Metric Analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed through the Nextcloud app interface, which is network accessible.  
- So, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack involves zipping files to download them. No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "users can download 'view-only' files by zipping the complete folder."  
- This implies the attacker must be a user with at least view-only access.  
- So, PR = Low (L) (since the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with view-only access, not no privileges)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must trigger the zip operation themselves.  
- So, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to files within the same Nextcloud instance.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unauthorized access to "view-only" files by zipping the folder.  
- This is a confidentiality impact.  
- Since files can be downloaded that should not be accessible, this is a High impact.  
- So, C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that files can be modified or corrupted.  
- So, I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- So, A = None (N)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44) = 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 2.05, 10)) = round_up(5.6452) = 5.7

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The iaware module has a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect the system functions."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability.
- **Impact:** May affect system functions.
- **Module:** iaware module (likely part of an OS or system-level component).
- **Effect:** "May affect system functions" suggests potential impact on availability or integrity, possibly confidentiality as well, but not explicitly stated.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- UAF vulnerabilities in system modules are often exploitable remotely if the module is exposed over the network, or locally if the module is only accessible locally.  
- Since the description does not specify remote exploitation or local access, but "iaware module" sounds like a system component, likely local.  
- However, many UAF vulnerabilities in system modules require local access.  
- **Assign:** Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- UAF vulnerabilities often require specific conditions but are generally straightforward to exploit once conditions are met.  
- No mention of complex conditions or environment.  
- **Assign:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since it is a system module, exploitation may require some privileges.  
- No explicit mention of needing privileges, but usually local UAFs require at least low privileges.  
- **Assign:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- UAFs typically do not require user interaction if attacker can trigger the vulnerability directly.  
- **Assign:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- "May affect system functions" suggests impact beyond the vulnerable component, possibly affecting other components or system-wide.  
- UAF vulnerabilities often lead to privilege escalation or system compromise, changing scope.  
- **Assign:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No explicit mention of confidentiality impact.  
- "May affect system functions" is vague, but UAFs can lead to information disclosure.  
- Since not explicitly stated, assign Low (L) to reflect possible but not confirmed impact.  
- **Assign:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- UAF can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of data, so integrity is likely impacted.  
- "May affect system functions" supports this.  
- **Assign:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- "May affect system functions" can imply denial of service or system crash.  
- UAFs often cause crashes or instability.  
- **Assign:** High (H)

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

#####405#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The WP Plugin Lister WordPress plugin through 2.1.0 does not have CSRF check in some places, and is missing sanitisation as well as escaping, which could allow attackers to make logged in admin add Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
- The attacker can cause a logged-in admin to add Stored XSS payloads.
- The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in admin user to perform the action.
- The vulnerability affects a WordPress plugin, so the attack is likely over the network.
- The attacker does **not** have direct access to the system but relies on the admin's session.
- The impact is Stored XSS, which can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts depending on the payload.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS base metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (via CSRF).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires the victim (admin) to be logged in and to be tricked into performing an action (CSRF).  
- CSRF attacks are generally considered low complexity if no additional conditions are required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges themselves but relies on the victim's privileges.  
- The attacker is unauthenticated, but the victim must be an admin.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, PR is based on the attacker's privileges, not the victim's.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim (admin) to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject Stored XSS payloads that affect the same security scope (the WordPress plugin/site).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This implies at least a Low confidentiality impact.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially modifying content or actions.  
- This implies at least a Low integrity impact.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS generally does not directly impact availability.  
- No indication of availability impact in the description.  
- **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via CSRF |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | Attacker requires no privileges |
| UI     | R     | Requires victim user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Stored XSS can leak info |
| I      | L     | Stored XSS can modify content |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.35

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.35 + 2.69, 10))  
= round_up(5.04) = 5.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####406#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Biteship WordPress plugin before version 2.2.25. It occurs because the plugin does not sanitize and escape certain parameters before outputting them back to the page. This can be exploited against high privilege users such as admin.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is a reflected XSS, which typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link or input that the victim (user) must open or interact with.  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network (e.g., via a URL).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Reflected XSS usually requires the attacker to craft a specific payload and lure the victim to click a malicious link.  
- However, this is generally considered low complexity because no special conditions or environment are needed beyond user interaction.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system to perform the attack; the attack is against users with high privileges (e.g., admin), but the attacker themselves does not need privileges.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Reflected XSS requires the victim to interact with the malicious input, typically by clicking a link or visiting a URL.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the WordPress plugin and the user session).  
- The impact is on the same security authority (the plugin and user context).  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the user.  
- This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality because the attacker can only access what the user can access.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially modifying data.  
- This is typically Low impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N).

| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible modification of user data                                                       |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability                                                                |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.51 + 2.83)  
= Roundup (5.34)  
= 5.4 (Medium severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A command injection vulnerability exists in the gena.cgi module of D-Link DAP-1650 devices. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain command execution on the device as root.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the `gena.cgi` module, which is typically accessed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to send crafted input to the vulnerable CGI.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The attacker gains command execution as root on the device itself. The impact is within the same security scope (the device).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Command execution as root implies full access to data on the device, so confidentiality is fully compromised.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Command execution as root allows full modification of data and system files.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Command execution as root can disrupt or disable the device, impacting availability.  
  **Value:** High (H)

#####408#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Dell Unity versions prior to 5.4
- Vulnerability: Path traversal in svc_supportassist utility
- Attacker: Authenticated attacker
- Impact: Unauthorized write access to files on the server filesystem with elevated privileges

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited via the svc_supportassist utility on the server.  
- Since it involves a utility on the server, and the attacker is authenticated, it is likely local or adjacent.  
- However, path traversal vulnerabilities often require local access or at least adjacent network access.  
- Given the description, it is likely **Local (L)** because the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the utility on the server.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Path traversal vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is authenticated, so **Privileges Required** is not None.  
- The attacker gains elevated privileges after exploitation, but initially, the attacker is authenticated.  
- The description does not specify the level of privileges before exploitation, but since the attacker is authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability, it is likely **Low (L)** privileges required (not high).  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is authenticated and exploits the vulnerability directly.  
- No mention of needing another user to interact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker gains elevated privileges and unauthorized write access to files on the server filesystem.  
- This suggests the impact crosses privilege boundaries or security domains.  
- The scope is likely **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions unauthorized write access, but no mention of data disclosure.  
- So, confidentiality impact is **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unauthorized write access means integrity is impacted.  
- The attacker can modify files, so **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.246  
≈ 2.02

**Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Biteship Plugin Ongkos Kirim Kurir Instant, Reguler, Kargo allows Reflected XSS.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link to the victim, and the victim must access it over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
  Therefore, AV = Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond the victim clicking a malicious link. No complex conditions or environment needed.  
  Therefore, AC = Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system; the attack is performed by tricking a user into clicking a link.  
  Therefore, PR = None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Reflected XSS requires the victim to click a malicious link or visit a crafted URL.  
  Therefore, UI = Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Reflected XSS typically affects the same security scope (same web application). It does not escalate privileges or affect other components.  
  Therefore, S = Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the user. This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
  Therefore, C = Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Reflected XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify the content seen by the user, potentially altering data or commands executed in the user's context. This is a partial loss of integrity.  
  Therefore, I = Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  Therefore, A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize Metric Values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.68) = Roundup(5.19) = 5.2

#####410#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The nearby module has a privilege escalation vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect availability."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description says "nearby module," which suggests the attacker must be close to the target system, likely on the same physical or logical network segment. This usually corresponds to **Adjacent (A)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity. Privilege escalation vulnerabilities often require some conditions but nothing complex is stated. Assume **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  It's a privilege escalation vulnerability, meaning the attacker must already have some privileges to escalate. So, **Low (L)** or **High (H)**?  
  Since it is privilege escalation, the attacker must have some privileges but not necessarily high. Usually, privilege escalation means going from low to high privileges, so **Low (L)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. Usually privilege escalation vulnerabilities do not require user interaction. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  Privilege escalation usually means the impact is within the same security scope (e.g., same system). So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No mention of confidentiality impact. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of integrity impact. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description says "may affect availability." So, **Low (L)** or **High (H)**? Since it says "may affect availability" without specifying severity, assume **Low (L)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | "nearby module" implies Adjacent |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions mentioned |
| PR     | L     | Privilege escalation requires some privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction mentioned |
| S      | U     | Privilege escalation within same scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact mentioned |
| A      | L     | Availability impact mentioned as possible |

- The attack is performed over the network (HTTP request).  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must trick an admin into clicking a link (social engineering), but no special conditions or environment complexity is required.  
- CSRF attacks generally have low complexity if user interaction is possible.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The admin must be tricked into clicking a link or performing an action.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:L (0.22)  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.344  
≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged):**  
Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.34)  
= 5.4 (Medium severity)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered via a parameter (`iptv.city.vlan`), which suggests it can be exploited remotely over the network (e.g., via a web interface or network service).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Stack overflow vulnerabilities triggered by a parameter usually do not require special conditions beyond sending a crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention needing any privileges to exploit. Usually, parameters like this are accessible without authentication or with minimal privileges. Assume no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker likely sends a crafted request directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Stack overflow in a function of the device firmware likely affects the same security scope (the device itself). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stack overflow can lead to code execution or crash. No explicit mention of data disclosure, but code execution can lead to confidentiality impact. However, since it's not explicitly stated, assume at least Low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Stack overflow can allow code execution or modification of data, so integrity is impacted.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Stack overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.474 ≈ 3.895

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.475 = 0.525

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.525 = 3.37

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.37 + 3.895, 10))  
= round_up(7.265) = 7.3 → 7.3 rounds to 7.3 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

#####413#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Task Manager App v1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the Note Section parameter at /TaskManager/Tasks.php.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted payload to a web application parameter. This can be done remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require low complexity to exploit if the input is not sanitized. The description does not mention any special conditions or complex steps.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker injects payload into a parameter, presumably without needing to be authenticated or have any privileges. The description does not mention authentication or privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attacker usually needs a victim to interact with the malicious script (e.g., by visiting a crafted URL or viewing the injected content).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim's browser (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content seen by the user, which affects integrity of displayed data. This is typically considered **Low** impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: L (Low)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

#####414#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"GPAC v2.3 was detected to contain a buffer overflow via the function gf_isom_new_generic_sample_description function in the isomedia/isom_write.c:4577"

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Buffer overflow  
- **Component:** Function in a media processing library (GPAC)  
- **Impact:** Buffer overflow typically allows for code execution or crash, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a media processing library, the attack likely occurs when processing crafted media files. The attacker would need to supply a malicious media file to the victim system. This implies the attack is likely **Local (L)** or **Adjacent (A)**, depending on how the file is delivered and processed.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Is the attack remotely exploitable over a network?  
- If the vulnerable function is called when processing a media file, the attacker must get the victim to open or process the file.  
- If the file is processed locally (e.g., user opens a file), the vector is **Local (L)**.  
- If the file can be exploited over a network share or similar, it could be Adjacent (A).  
- Since no network service is mentioned, and the vulnerability is in a media processing function, the most reasonable assumption is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are often straightforward to exploit if the attacker can control the input.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Does the attacker need privileges on the system?  
- Since the attacker must supply a crafted file to the victim, no privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does the user need to do something?  
- The user must open or process the malicious media file.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- Buffer overflow in a media processing library can lead to code execution, potentially affecting the entire system.  
- Usually, this means **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to information disclosure.  
- Likely **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow code execution or modification of data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Borbis Media FreshMail For WordPress.

**Step 1: Understand the vulnerability**

- **Type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Affected product:** FreshMail For WordPress plugin
- **Impact:** CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs an action without their consent.

**Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric**

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically executed over the network since the attacker lures the victim to a malicious website or sends a crafted link. The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page). However, no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed. This is generally considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need privileges on the target system; however, the victim must be authenticated (have privileges) for the attack to succeed. The attacker themselves has no privileges.  
  According to CVSS v3.1, PR is from the attacker's perspective. Since the attacker does not need privileges, PR is None (N).  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF usually does not lead to information disclosure directly. It causes unauthorized actions but not data leaks.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF can cause unauthorized changes or actions, which impacts integrity. Usually, this is considered Low or High depending on the action. Since the description is generic and no indication of full control or destructive actions, we assign Low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

**Step 3: Summary of metric values**

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)

- A: N (None)

**Step 4: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score**

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(4.09)  
= 4.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 4.1 (Medium severity)**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the uploadMib functionality of ManageEngine OpManager 12.7.258. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary file creation. An attacker can send a malicious MiB file to trigger this vulnerability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious MiB file. No special conditions or timing are mentioned. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges before exploiting the vulnerability. The attacker can send the malicious request directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the malicious request directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary file creation on the system. This likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., the file system). This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary file creation, but no direct mention of data disclosure. However, arbitrary file creation can lead to data disclosure if files are overwritten or created with sensitive content. Since the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact, but arbitrary file creation can indirectly affect confidentiality, we assign:  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary file creation directly impacts integrity because the attacker can create or overwrite files.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary file creation could potentially overwrite critical files and disrupt service, but the description does not explicitly mention availability impact. Given the potential, but no explicit mention, assign:  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Summary of Metric Values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via HTTP request |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security scope (file system) |
| C      | L     | Possible indirect confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Arbitrary file creation impacts integrity |
| A      | L     | Possible availability impact due to file creation |

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L

---

### Optional: Calculate Base Score (for completeness)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability = 8.22** (calculated as 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85)  
**Impact = 0.56 + 0.22 + 0.22 = 1.0 (adjusted for scope changed)**

Final Base Score is approximately **8.8 (High severity)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
AWS Encryption SDK for Java versions 2.0.0 to 2.2.0 and less than 1.9.0 incorrectly validates some invalid ECDSA signatures.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The issue is incorrect validation of some invalid ECDSA signatures.
- This is a cryptographic validation flaw.
- Such a flaw can allow an attacker to bypass signature verification, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data exposure.
- The vulnerability is in a Java SDK, so exploitation likely requires the attacker to supply crafted signatures to the SDK.
- The SDK is a library, so the attack vector depends on how the SDK is used. Typically, the SDK is used in applications that receive data over the network or locally.
- Since the flaw is in signature validation, an attacker might be able to send crafted data to an application using the SDK to bypass signature checks.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The flaw is in a software library used in applications.  
- Exploitation likely requires sending crafted data to the application using the SDK.  
- This can be over the network if the application accepts network input.  
- Since the SDK is used in applications that process data, the most reasonable assumption is Network (N).  
**AV:N**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The flaw is incorrect validation of signatures, which is a straightforward cryptographic bypass.  
- No special conditions or environment needed.  
- So, Low complexity.  
**AC:L**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to supply crafted signatures to the application using the SDK.  
- Usually, signature verification is done on data received from untrusted sources.  
- So, no privileges required to supply data.  
**PR:N**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted data to the application.  
- No user interaction required for the attack to succeed.  
**UI:N**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the SDK's signature validation.  
- If the flaw allows bypassing signature verification, it could lead to impact beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., unauthorized access or data exposure in the application).  
- This suggests the scope is Changed (C).  
**S:C**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Incorrect signature validation can allow unauthorized access to data or operations.  
- This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.  
- Assign High (H) if full data disclosure is possible, Low (L) if partial.  
- Since the description is vague, but signature validation bypass often leads to full compromise, assign High.  
**C:H**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Bypassing signature validation can allow an attacker to modify data or commands without detection.  
- This is a high integrity impact.  
**I:H**

**Availability (A):**  
- The flaw does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- Assign None (N).  
**A:N**

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 = approx 4.3 (approximate intermediate step)

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 7.52 * 0.8064  
= 6.06

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 * (6.06 + 4.3) = 1.08 * 10.36 = 11.19 → capped at 10.0

**Final Base Score = 10.0 (Critical)**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient encoding of user inputs.
- Location: /cupseasylive/itempopup.php, description parameter.
- Impact: Remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user and steal session cookie credentials.
- Exploitation requires the user to be authenticated (implied by "authenticated user").
- Attack vector: Remote attacker sends a URL (likely over the network).
- Impact: Theft of session cookies implies confidentiality impact.
- No direct mention of integrity or availability impact.
- User interaction: Required (user must click or visit the crafted URL).
- Privileges required: The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be authenticated (victim's privileges matter for impact, but for PR metric, it is the attacker’s privileges).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a URL remotely over the network.  
- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires crafting a URL and the victim to visit it.  
- No special conditions or timing required, so low complexity.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system.  
- The victim must be authenticated, but this does not affect the attacker's privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must click or visit the malicious URL.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session cookie credentials, which is a high confidentiality impact.  
- C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the attacker can modify data or affect integrity.  
- I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of availability impact.  
- A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(3.59 + 2.82, 10)) = Roundup(6.41) = 6.4

- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.22

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

#####421#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Skyworth Router CM5100, version 4.1.1.24.
- Insufficient validation of user input for the Identity parameter under Local endpoint settings at its web interface.
- A remote attacker can exploit this by supplying specially crafted input to the web interface.
- Successful exploitation allows stored XSS attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker exploits the web interface remotely by sending crafted input.  
- The web interface is accessible remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, which is typically straightforward to exploit.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and can send input to the web interface.  
- The description does not mention needing any authentication or privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted input directly to the web interface.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stored XSS on the targeted system itself.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This implies some confidentiality impact, but not full system compromise.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or executing unauthorized actions.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- Therefore, Integrity = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- No indication of availability impact.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N).

| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Some confidentiality impact due to possible data theft via XSS.                           |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Some integrity impact due to script injection/modification.                               |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact.                                                                   |

- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
flusity-CMS v2.33 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /core/tools/delete_menu.php.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and impact

- **Vulnerability type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
- **Affected component:** /core/tools/delete_menu.php  
- **Effect:** An attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions (like deleting a menu) without their consent.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network by tricking a user into visiting a malicious site or clicking a link.  
- The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page).  
- This is a common and straightforward attack, no special conditions or environment needed.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must be authenticated (have privileges).  
- The attacker themselves has no privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the CMS application).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- CSRF typically does not disclose information.  
- No confidentiality impact.  
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can cause unauthorized changes (e.g., delete a menu).  
- This is a modification of data.  
- Integrity impact is Low (L) because it affects some data but not the entire system or all data.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- Deleting a menu could affect availability of that menu or functionality.  
- This is a partial impact, not a complete denial of service.  
- Availability impact is Low (L)  
- A = Low (L)

| Privileges Required (PR)| N    | Attacker needs no privileges                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact (visit malicious page)    |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Same security scope                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No info disclosure                              |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Unauthorized modification (delete menu)        |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Partial impact on availability                  |

#####423#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter nft_limit module.
- The issue is a divide error caused by using div_u64() (which divides u64 by u32) instead of div64_u64() (which divides u64 by u64).
- This is a coding error leading to a possible divide error (likely a crash or kernel panic).
- The call trace shows this happens in kernel space.
- The vulnerability is fixed by correcting the math function used.
- The context is the Linux kernel, specifically netfilter nft_limit_init.
- The attack vector is likely through netfilter/netlink interfaces.
- The kernel is running on Google Compute Engine, so remote access is possible.
- The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (denial of service).
- No indication of privilege escalation or information disclosure.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending malformed netlink messages (netlink_unicast, sock_sendmsg, etc.).
- The attacker likely needs to send a specially crafted netlink message to trigger the bug.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending netlink messages.
- Netlink sockets are accessible locally or sometimes remotely depending on configuration.
- However, netlink is a local IPC mechanism, not accessible over the network.
- The description shows the kernel running on Google Compute Engine, but the attack vector is through netlink socket.
- Netlink sockets are accessible only locally or by adjacent systems (e.g., local users or containers).
- Since netlink is local IPC, **AV: Local (L)**.

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The vulnerability is a coding error causing a divide error.
- The attacker must send a specially crafted netlink message.
- No indication of complex conditions or timing.
- The attack is straightforward once the attacker can send netlink messages.
- **AC: Low (L)**.

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- To send netlink messages, the attacker usually needs some privileges.
- Netlink sockets for netfilter are typically restricted to privileged users (root or CAP_NET_ADMIN).
- So, the attacker needs **High privileges (H)**.
- However, if unprivileged users can send netlink messages to nft_limit, PR could be Low or None.
- Given netfilter configuration, usually CAP_NET_ADMIN is required.
- So, **PR: High (H)**.

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The attack is triggered by sending crafted netlink messages.
- No user interaction required.
- **UI: None (N)**.

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (denial of service).
- The impact is within the kernel, but the kernel is a different security authority than user processes.
- Kernel crash affects the entire system.
- The vulnerability affects kernel memory and system availability.
- Since the impact crosses from user space to kernel space and affects system availability, **Scope: Changed (C)**.

#### Confidentiality (C)
- No indication of information disclosure.
- **C: None (N)**.

#### Integrity (I)
- No indication of data modification or privilege escalation.
- **I: None (N)**.

#### Availability (A)
- Kernel crash causes denial of service.
- Impact on availability is **High (H)**.

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Attack via local netlink socket |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trigger |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges (CAP_NET_ADMIN) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Kernel crash affects system scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High impact on availability (kernel crash) |

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 when Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Explaining PR value:**

- For Scope Changed, PR:H = 0.27

---

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 × 0.77 = 3.482  
3.482 × 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 × 0.85 = 0.799

Exploitability ≈ 0.80

---

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

Since Scope is Changed:

Impact Subscore = 7.52 × (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.56 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.56 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.531 - 3.25 × (0.54)^15

Calculate (0.54)^15:

0.54^15 ≈ 0.0004 (very small)

So:

Impact Subscore ≈ 7.52 × 0.531 - 3.25 × 0.0004  
= 3.993 - 0.0013  
= 3.9917 ≈ 3.99

---

**Base Score:**

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [3.99 + 0.80, 10])  
= Roundup (4.79)  
= 4.8

#####426#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One plug-in manager origin validation.
- Allows a local attacker to escalate privileges.
- Attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- No mention of user interaction required.
- The vulnerability affects local privilege escalation, so the scope likely changes (privilege escalation usually implies scope change).

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The attacker must already have local code execution.  
   - Exploitation requires local access.  
   - **Value:** Local (L)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - No indication of special conditions or complexity beyond having local code execution.  
   - The attacker must have low-privileged code execution, but that is a precondition, not complexity of the attack itself.  
   - The vulnerability itself does not require complex conditions.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code.  
   - So, attacker has Low privileges initially.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - No mention that user interaction is required.  
   - The attacker already has code execution, so no user interaction needed.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which means the attacker can affect resources beyond their initial privileges.  
   - This implies a change in scope.  
   - **Value:** Changed (C)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - Privilege escalation can lead to access to sensitive information.  
   - Usually, local privilege escalation vulnerabilities are rated as Low confidentiality impact unless explicitly stated as High.  
   - Since the description does not specify data disclosure, assume Low.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - Privilege escalation allows modification of system or application data.  
   - This is typically High impact on integrity.  
   - **Value:** High (H)

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - No mention of availability impact.

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

#####427#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
An issue in Plone Docker Official Image 5.2.13 (5221) open-source software that could allow for remote code execution due to a package listed in ++plone++static/components not existing in the public package index (npm).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows remote code execution. Since it involves a package in a Docker image and the package is missing from the public npm registry, the attacker likely needs to interact remotely (e.g., by pulling or building the image). This suggests the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The issue arises because a package is missing from the public npm registry, which is a supply chain problem. Exploiting this requires the attacker to publish a malicious package with the same name or otherwise manipulate the package index. This is not trivial but also not highly complex for a motivated attacker.  
  Given the dependency on external package publishing and timing, the complexity is likely **High (H)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit this; the vulnerability is in the image build or runtime process.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker can exploit this without requiring user interaction, as the image build or deployment process automatically pulls packages.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows remote code execution, which likely affects the container or host system beyond the vulnerable component. If the vulnerability leads to code execution outside the security scope of the vulnerable component, scope is changed.  
  Since this is remote code execution in a container image, it likely affects the container runtime or host, so scope is **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Remote code execution typically leads to full confidentiality impact.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Remote code execution allows full control, so integrity is fully compromised.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Remote code execution can disrupt availability (e.g., by deleting files, stopping services).  
  **A = High (H)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation for Scope Changed:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85 ≈ 2.56

- Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
  = 7.52 × 0.915 ≈ 6.88

- Base Score = 1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability)  
  = 1.08 × (6.88 + 2.56)  
  = 1.08 × 9.44 ≈ 10.19 → capped at 10.0

#####428#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Dell Unity, versions prior to 5.4
- Vulnerability: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Attacker: Authenticated attacker
- Impact: Steal session info, impersonate user, perform user actions, control victim's browser

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker exploits a web vulnerability (XSS).  
- Typically, XSS can be exploited remotely over the network (via a web interface).  
- So, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS vulnerabilities are generally low complexity if the attacker is authenticated and can inject scripts.  
- So, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated.  
- Authenticated means some privileges are required, but not necessarily high.  
- Usually, "authenticated attacker" corresponds to Low privileges (L).  
- So, PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits XSS to control the victim's browser.  
- This usually requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page).  
- So, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to control the victim's browser or perform actions as the user.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the user session).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session information.  
- This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
- The description suggests significant data exposure (session tokens).  
- So, C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can masquerade as the user and perform any actions the user can perform.  
- This implies the attacker can modify data or perform unauthorized actions.  
- So, I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- So, A = None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via web |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity exploitation |
| PR     | L     | Requires authentication (low privileges) |
| UI     | R     | Requires victim user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (session info stolen) |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact (actions as user) |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.3844  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.296  
≈ 8.22 × 0.2516  
≈ 2.07

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936  
= 0.8064

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.8064  
= 5.18

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 2.07, 10))  
= round_up(7.25)  
= 7.3

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N**

#####429#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is an **information leakage** issue.
- It is caused by a function generating deterministic UUIDs on user request.
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of `cdo-local-uuid` and `case-utils`.
- The vulnerability is in a Python function, implying it is exploitable via software usage.
- No mention of required privileges or user interaction.
- No indication that the scope changes (i.e., the vulnerability affects the same security authority).
- The impact is information leakage, so confidentiality is affected.
- No mention of integrity or availability impact.

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The vulnerability is exploitable via a function call in software. Since it is a function in a Python library, it is likely exploitable remotely if the software is exposed over a network or locally if the attacker has local access. The description does not specify network exposure, but since it is a library function, it is most likely local or adjacent.  
   - Given the lack of explicit network exposure, and that the function is called locally by a user, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   The vulnerability is caused by a deterministic UUID generation on user request, which is straightforward to exploit once the function is called. No special conditions or timing required.  
   - **Low (L)**

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   The function is called by a user, and the vulnerability is triggered on user request. No mention of needing elevated privileges.  
   - **None (N)**

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   The user must request the UUID generation to trigger the vulnerability. The user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.  
   - **Required (R)**

5. **Scope (S):**  
   The vulnerability affects the same component (the library/function) and does not affect other components or security authorities.  
   - **Unchanged (U)**

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   Information leakage vulnerability implies some confidentiality impact. The description does not specify the severity of the leakage, so assume **Low (L)**.  
   - **Low (L)**

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
   - **None (N)**

8. **Availability (A):**  
   No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
   - **None (N)**

|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local function call required |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must request UUID generation |
| S      | U     | No scope change |

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
```

---

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for completeness)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:N = 0.00
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78) = 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.41

**Base Score = Round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= Round_up(1.41 + 1.82) = Round_up(3.23) = 3.2 (rounded to 3.2)

---

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 3.2 (Low severity)**

#####430#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sunlight CMS 8.0.1 allows an authenticated low-privileged user to escalate privileges via a crafted SVG file in the File Manager component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited by an authenticated user uploading a crafted SVG file via the File Manager component.  
- The attack likely requires network access to the web application (uploading the file remotely).  
- Since the attacker interacts over the network (web interface), AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must craft a specific SVG file to exploit the vulnerability.  
- However, this is a typical XSS attack vector and does not require special conditions beyond crafting the file.  
- No indication of high complexity or special conditions.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated low-privileged user.  
- So, privileges are required, but low-level privileges suffice.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS typically requires a victim user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., viewing the SVG file or triggering the XSS).  
- The description does not explicitly say the attacker can exploit without user interaction.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation within the same application (Sunlight CMS).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes the security scope.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- The description mentions privilege escalation, which implies some confidentiality impact.  
- Usually, XSS leads to at least Low confidentiality impact.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Privilege escalation implies the attacker can modify data or perform actions beyond their privileges.  
- So, integrity is impacted at least at a Low level.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- A = None (N).

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: Low (L)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####431#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Delta Electronics WPLSoft. An anonymous attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DVP file to achieve code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must entice a user to open a specially crafted file. This implies the attacker does not need local access or physical access, but the attack requires the user to open a file, likely delivered over a network or removable media. Since the attacker can be anonymous and the file can be sent over a network (e.g., email, download), the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to craft a malicious file and have the user open it. There are no special conditions or environment requirements mentioned. This is a straightforward attack. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is anonymous and does not need any privileges on the target system before the attack. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must open the specially crafted file. This requires user interaction. So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to code execution. Usually, code execution in the same software component means the scope is **Unchanged (U)**. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution typically allows full control, including reading sensitive data. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows modification of data and system state. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can disrupt or disable the system or application. So, **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attacker can exploit remotely by sending a file over the network.                          |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed before attack.                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must open the malicious file.                                                        |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact is within the vulnerable component.                                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Code execution leads to full data disclosure.                                            |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Code execution allows full modification.                                                 |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Code execution can cause system/application disruption.                                  |

### Step 3: Construct the CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

---

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####432#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel i2c i801 driver.
- The issue is a missing reset of the block buffer index during block process call transactions.
- This causes the wrong portion of the block buffer to be read.
- The vulnerability is related to incorrect data being read from the buffer.

---

### Step 1: Determine the Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in a kernel driver for i2c (Inter-Integrated Circuit), which is a hardware communication protocol.
- Typically, i2c devices are accessed locally on the machine or via physical proximity.
- Since i2c is a hardware bus, exploitation would require local access to the device or physical access.
- Therefore, **AV: Local (L)** or possibly **Physical (P)**.
- However, physical access means the attacker must physically interact with the device (e.g., plug in hardware).
- Local means attacker has local system access (e.g., logged in user or local process).
- Since this is a kernel driver, and the vulnerability is in the driver code, an attacker would need to run code locally to trigger the vulnerability.
- So, **AV: Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is due to a missing reset in the driver.
- Exploiting it requires performing block process call transactions.
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.
- The attacker needs to perform specific i2c transactions, but this is straightforward if local access is available.
- So, **AC: Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- To interact with the i2c driver, the attacker likely needs some privileges.
- Usually, accessing i2c devices requires at least some user privileges or root.
- However, in Linux, i2c devices are often accessible only by root or users in specific groups.
- So, **PR: High (H)** if root is required, or **Low (L)** if a non-root user can access the device.
- Since this is a kernel driver, and i2c device files are usually restricted, assume **PR: High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The vulnerability is triggered by block process call transactions.
- This is a programmatic action, no user interaction required.
- So, **UI: None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is in the kernel driver.
- The impact is on the kernel's data buffer.
- If the vulnerability allows reading incorrect data, it affects kernel memory or device data.
- The scope is likely **Unchanged (U)** because the impact is within the same security authority (kernel).
- So, **S: Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The vulnerability causes the wrong portion of the block buffer to be read.
- This could lead to disclosure of incorrect or unintended data.
- The impact is on confidentiality.
- The description does not specify if the data is sensitive or if the disclosure is partial.
- So, **C: Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- The vulnerability is about reading wrong data, not modifying data.
- No indication that data can be modified or corrupted.
- So, **I: None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**

- No indication that the vulnerability causes denial of service or affects availability.
- So, **A: None (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Base Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to interact with i2c driver |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | H     | High privileges likely required to access i2c device |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within kernel scope, no scope change |
| C      | L     | Partial disclosure of incorrect data |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:N = 0.00
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.55 = 4.521

4.521 * 0.77 = 3.481

3.481 * 0.27 = 0.940

0.940 * 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)

= 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.412

**Base Score =**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(min(1.412 + 0.799, 10))

= round_up(2.211)

= 2.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

# Final Answer:

Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)  
Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  
Privileges Required (PR): High (H)

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

#####433#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Insufficient authentication flow in Checkmk before 2.2.0p18, 2.1.0p38 and 2.0.0p39 allows attacker to use locked credentials"

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Insufficient authentication flow**: This suggests a weakness in the authentication mechanism.
- **Allows attacker to use locked credentials**: The attacker can bypass or misuse credentials that should be locked, implying unauthorized access.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**  
   Since this is an authentication flow issue in Checkmk (a monitoring software), and the attacker can exploit it remotely (likely over the network), the vector is:  
   **AV:N (Network)**

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**  
   The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker can use locked credentials directly.  
   **AC:L (Low)**

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**  
   The attacker uses locked credentials, which implies the attacker already has some credentials (but locked). So the attacker has some level of privilege, but those credentials are locked.  
   Since the attacker must have credentials (even if locked), this is likely **PR:L (Low)**.  
   - If the attacker had no credentials, PR:N would be appropriate.  
   - Since the attacker uses locked credentials, PR:L fits better than PR:N.

4. **User Interaction (UI)**  
   The attacker exploits the authentication flow directly; no user interaction is required.  
   **UI:N (None)**

5. **Scope (S)**  
   The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication, which affects the same security authority (Checkmk application). No indication that the scope changes to another component.  
   **S:U (Unchanged)**

6. **Confidentiality (C)**  
   Using locked credentials likely allows access to information that should be protected. This implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
   Since the attacker can authenticate as a locked user, likely **C:L (Low)**.

7. **Integrity (I)**  
   If the attacker can authenticate, they may be able to modify data or configurations. However, the description only mentions authentication bypass, not explicit modification.  
   To be conservative, assign **I:L (Low)**.

8. **Availability (A)**  
   No mention of availability impact.  
   **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Summary of metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (locked credentials) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to one decimal place of:  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else if Scope Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.51 + 2.68) = Roundup (5.19) = 5.2

#####434#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue in SpringBlade v.3.7.0 and before allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the lack of permissions control framework."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote, so the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description implies a straightforward privilege escalation due to missing permission controls, no special conditions mentioned.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and "escalate privileges," implying the attacker starts with no privileges.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the attack.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Privilege escalation typically means the attacker gains higher privileges within the same security scope (e.g., same application or system). However, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond the initially vulnerable component, scope changes.  
  The description says "escalate privileges," which usually means the scope changes because the attacker gains control beyond their initial privileges.  
  **S:C (Changed)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Privilege escalation often leads to increased access to confidential information. Since the attacker gains higher privileges, confidentiality is impacted.  
  **C:H (High)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  With escalated privileges, the attacker can modify data or system state.  
  **I:H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of impact on availability.  
  **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) — since Scope is Changed, PR:N is 0.85
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore (Changed Scope):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 7.52 * 0.8064 ≈ 6.06

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else, since Scope is Changed:  
BaseScore = round_up (min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up (min(1.08 * (6.06 + 3.88), 10))  
= round_up (min(1.08 * 9.94, 10))  
= round_up (10.73, 10)  
= 10.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in admin/change-password.php via the argument cpass.
- Impact: Critical.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Affected software: PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 1.0.
- Unknown functionality affected.
- No explicit mention of authentication or user privileges required.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- SQL Injection typically can be exploited remotely over the network if the vulnerable parameter is accessible via a web interface.  
- Since the vulnerability is in a web application file (admin/change-password.php), it is likely exploitable over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection is generally straightforward if the input is not sanitized.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in admin/change-password.php, which suggests it might be an admin-only page.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say whether authentication is required or not.  
- Since it is an admin page, it is reasonable to assume some privileges are required.  
- But the description says "unknown functionality" and does not clarify if authentication is needed.  
- Given the uncertainty, but leaning towards requiring some privileges (admin), we assign:  
- **PR = High (H)** (since admin-level privileges are likely required)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- SQL Injection typically does not require user interaction beyond the attacker sending crafted input.  
- The attacker directly manipulates the argument cpass.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data leakage or modification within the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since it is critical and SQL Injection, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow data modification.  
- Likely high impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but not always.  
- No explicit mention of availability impact.  
- To be conservative, assign low impact.  
- **A = Low (L)**

### Summary of metric values:

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:H (High)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:L (Low)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(6.68) = 6.7

#####436#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the "Class Name" argument in /add_classes.php.
- Attack Vector: Possible to initiate the attack remotely.
- Attack Complexity: Not explicitly stated, but typical XSS attacks are usually low complexity.

- User Interaction: Usually, XSS requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link).
- Scope: Not stated, but XSS typically affects the same security scope (web application).
- Impact: XSS impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some extent, but usually low or none for availability.

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  "It is possible to initiate the attack remotely."  
  This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No special conditions or complex steps mentioned. XSS is generally low complexity.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  No mention of needing any privileges. The attacker can send malicious input remotely.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS typically requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
  **UI:R (Required)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  XSS usually affects the same security scope (the web application itself). No indication of scope change.  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). Usually considered Low impact.  
  **C:L (Low)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user, so Low impact.  
  **I:L (Low)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not affect availability.  
  **A:N (None)**

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.68)  
= round_up(5.19)  
= 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic (approximate):

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.345 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.51 + 2.84) = Round_up (5.35) = 5.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) v1.0.
- Location: /cupseasylive/statecreate.php, in the stateid parameter.
- Cause: User-controlled inputs are not sufficiently encoded.
- Impact: Remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user and steal their session cookie credentials.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a URL, but no special conditions or environment are required.  
- The vulnerability is straightforward to exploit if the user visits the URL.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker targets an authenticated user, so the victim must be logged in.  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must have privileges (authenticated user).  
- For CVSS, PR is from the attacker's perspective. The attacker does not need privileges on the vulnerable system, but the victim must be authenticated.  
- Since the attacker does not need privileges on the vulnerable system, but the victim must be authenticated, PR is **None (N)**.  
- Note: The attacker is remote and does not need to be authenticated themselves; they rely on the victim being authenticated.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must click or visit the specially crafted URL.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component is described.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session cookie credentials, which is a confidentiality breach.  
- This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the attacker can modify data or content on the server.  
- The vulnerability is XSS, which primarily impacts confidentiality.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of impact on availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | Attacker does not need privileges |
| UI     | R     | Victim must interact (click URL) |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | H     | Session cookie theft impacts confidentiality highly |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 1 × 1)  
= 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.59

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.59 + 2.84)  
= Round_up (6.43)  
= 6.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
TOTOLINK A3300R V17.0.0cu.557_B20221024 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the enable parameter in the setWiFiScheduleCfg function.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a command injection via a function parameter (enable parameter in setWiFiScheduleCfg).  
- Typically, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the function is accessible over the network (e.g., via a web interface or API).  
- Since this is a router device, and the function is likely accessible via network management interface, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Command injection vulnerabilities usually require low complexity if the parameter is directly injectable without additional conditions.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not specify that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- If the function is accessible without authentication, PR = None (N).  
- If authentication is required, PR = Low (L) or High (H).  
- Since the description does not specify, but usually router management functions require authentication, but some vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated access.  
- To be conservative, assume **None (N)** (worst case).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Command injection typically does not require user interaction if the attacker can send the malicious request directly.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Command injection can lead to execution of arbitrary commands on the device, potentially affecting components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Usually, this changes the scope because the impact crosses privilege boundaries or components.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including reading sensitive data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Command injection allows arbitrary command execution, so integrity is fully compromised.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Command injection can disrupt system operation or cause denial of service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
SQL Injection vulnerability discovered in Gila CMS 1.15.4 and earlier allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts via the Area parameter under the Administration > Widget tab after the login portal.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network (web application).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection typically requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be logged in ("after the login portal"), so some privileges are required, but it is not specified that admin privileges are needed. Since it is under the Administration > Widget tab, it likely requires at least low privileges (non-admin user or admin user). Usually, administration tabs require higher privileges, but since it says "after the login portal" and not specifically admin, we assume low privileges required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is remote and can send the payload directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary web scripts, which implies impact beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., affecting the web application or other components). SQL Injection often leads to scope change because it can affect the database and application behavior.  
  However, the description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component. Since it allows execution of arbitrary web scripts, it likely affects the application scope.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**

- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:H (High)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Calculating the CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(7.10)  
= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

#####442#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"In vsp driver, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local denial of service with System execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a driver and requires local access (since it mentions "local denial of service"). It is not exploitable remotely or over the network.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The issue is a missing bounds check leading to an out-of-bounds write. This is typically straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which implies the attacker must already have high privileges (system-level).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker with system privileges can trigger the issue directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in a driver and leads to denial of service. Since it is a local denial of service and no indication that the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from one component to another), the scope is likely unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description only mentions denial of service, no data disclosure.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption beyond denial of service.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service is explicitly mentioned. The impact is on availability.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | L     | Local access required                           |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploitation                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| H   | System execution privileges needed              |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                    |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact does not cross security boundaries       |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N     | No confidentiality impact                        |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact                              |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Denial of service impact                         |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 * 0.77 = 3.482  
3.482 * 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 * 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 * 1 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.595

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact Subscore + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 0.799, 10))  
= round_up(4.394) = 4.4

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link to the victim, and the victim must access it over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted URL and the victim clicking it. No complex conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system; the attack is performed by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must click or interact with the malicious link for the attack to succeed.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Reflected XSS affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). It does not impact other components or security domains.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the web application. This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can inject scripts that may modify or manipulate data within the user's session or the web page content, but usually does not directly modify server-side data. This is generally considered **Low** impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value  | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N      | Attack is performed over the network via crafted URL.                                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L      | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N    | No privileges needed.                                                                      |
| User Interaction (UI)| R       | Victim must click/interact with malicious link.                                           |
| Scope (S)            | U       | Vulnerability affects the same security scope.                                           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L       | Possible disclosure of sensitive info (cookies, tokens).                                 |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.3

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####444#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"A use-after-free issue was addressed with improved memory management. This issue is fixed in watchOS 10, iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, tvOS 17, macOS Sonoma 14, Safari 17. Processing web content may lead to arbitrary code execution."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact:** May lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Affected components:** Web content processing in Safari and OSes.
- **Attack vector:** Since it involves processing web content, the attacker likely can exploit this remotely over the network by convincing a user to visit a malicious web page.
- **Privileges required:** None, as arbitrary code execution can be triggered by processing web content.
- **User interaction:** Required, because the user must process (e.g., visit) malicious web content.
- **Scope:** Likely changed, because arbitrary code execution in the browser can lead to control beyond the vulnerable component.
- **Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability:** Arbitrary code execution usually implies high impact on all three.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  Reason: Exploitable remotely via web content.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: No special conditions mentioned; typical use-after-free in web content is straightforward to exploit.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  Reason: No privileges needed to trigger the vulnerability.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  Reason: User must process (e.g., visit) malicious web content.

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)  
  Reason: Arbitrary code execution in the browser likely affects components beyond the vulnerable code, changing scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  Reason: Arbitrary code execution can lead to full data disclosure.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  Reason: Arbitrary code execution can allow full modification of data.

- **Availability (A):** High (H)  
  Reason: Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable system availability.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely via network                |

| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                             |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must process malicious web content        |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Arbitrary code execution changes scope          |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Full data disclosure possible                    |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Full data modification possible                  |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Full disruption possible                          |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####445#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
MetaGPT through 0.6.4 allows the QaEngineer role to execute arbitrary code because RunCode.run_script() passes shell metacharacters to subprocess.Popen.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Vulnerability type:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Affected component:** RunCode.run_script() function.
- **Cause:** Passing shell metacharacters to subprocess.Popen, leading to command injection.
- **Role required:** QaEngineer role.
- **Version affected:** through 0.6.4.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - Can the attacker exploit this remotely or locally?  
   - Since the vulnerability involves a role (QaEngineer) executing code, it implies the attacker must have access to the system or application with that role.  
   - Usually, roles imply some form of authenticated access, likely local or adjacent.  
   - However, if the role is assigned to a user who can interact over the network (e.g., via an API or web interface), the attack vector could be Network.  
   - Without explicit info, but since it's a role-based execution, and assuming the role is assigned to users who can interact remotely, **AV:N (Network)** is appropriate.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - Is the attack straightforward or does it require special conditions?  
   - The vulnerability is due to passing shell metacharacters directly to subprocess.Popen, which is a straightforward command injection.  
   - No special conditions mentioned.  
   - **AC:L (Low)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - The attacker must have the QaEngineer role to exploit this.  
   - This is a specific role, so some privileges are required.  
   - Is this a low or high privilege?  
   - Since the role can execute arbitrary code, it is likely a privileged role, but not necessarily admin.  
   - Usually, roles like "Engineer" are considered **Low** privileges (not None, not High).  
   - **PR:L (Low)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - Does exploitation require another user to do something?  
   - The attacker is the user with the QaEngineer role executing the code.  
   - No other user interaction is needed.  
   - **UI:N (None)**.

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component?  
   - Arbitrary code execution usually allows control beyond the vulnerable component.  
   - Since subprocess.Popen is used, the attacker can execute code on the host system, potentially affecting other components.  
   - This implies **Scope Changed (C)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
   - So, **C:H (High)**.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - Arbitrary code execution allows full modification of data.  
   - **I:H (High)**.

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or destroy availability.  
   - **A:H (High)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable over network by a user with the role.                                         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward command injection via shell metacharacters.                               |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires QaEngineer role, which is a low privilege role.                                  |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No other user interaction required.                                                       |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Arbitrary code execution affects system beyond vulnerable component.                       |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Full data disclosure possible.                                                            |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Full data modification possible.                                                          |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Full disruption of availability possible.                                                 |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.274  
  ≈ 2.25

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
  = 1 - 0.085  
  = 0.915

- Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
  = 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
  = 6.66 - 0.46  
  = 6.20

- Base Score = Round up to one decimal place:  
  Since Scope is Changed:  
  Base Score = min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
  = min(1.08 * (6.20 + 2.25), 10)  
  = min(1.08 * 8.45, 10)  
  = min(9.13, 10)

#####446#####
Let's analyze the vulnerability and assign CVSS v3.1 base metric values step-by-step.

---

### Summary of the vulnerability:
- The issue is in the Linux kernel's mlx5e driver.
- A function (`mlx5e_tx_reporter_dump_sq()`) incorrectly casts a pointer, leading to a kernel stack overflow and ultimately a kernel panic (fatal exception).
- This occurs during TX-timeout-recovery flow.
- The vulnerability causes a kernel panic (denial of service).
- The flaw is triggered internally in the kernel workqueue, likely by a network event (TX timeout).
- The vulnerability is a logic/implementation bug causing a crash (DoS).
- No indication of privilege escalation or information disclosure.
- The attack vector is likely local or adjacent, but let's analyze carefully.

---

### Step 1: Assign Attack Vector (AV)

- The vulnerability is in the kernel driver for a network device (mlx5e).
- The TX timeout is detected on a network interface (enp8s0f1).
- The bug is triggered by the TX timeout recovery flow, which is likely triggered by network traffic or network events.
- The attacker can cause the TX timeout by sending crafted network packets or causing network conditions.
- Therefore, the attack can be performed remotely over the network interface.

**AV = Network (N)**

---

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)

- The bug is triggered by a TX timeout, which is a specific condition.
- The attacker must cause a TX timeout, which may require specific timing or conditions.
- However, no special conditions or race conditions are mentioned.
- Causing a TX timeout is not trivial but not highly complex either.
- According to CVSS guidelines, if the attack requires some conditions but no special privileges or environment, AC is Low.

**AC = Low (L)**

---

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)

- The vulnerability is in the kernel network driver.
- The attacker can trigger it by sending network traffic.
- No indication that the attacker needs to be logged in or have any privileges on the system.
- Therefore, no privileges required.

**PR = None (N)**

---

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)

- The vulnerability is triggered by network events.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.

**UI = None (N)**

---

### Step 5: Scope (S)

- The vulnerability causes a kernel panic (system crash).
- The impact crosses from the vulnerable component (mlx5e kernel module) to the entire system.
- Kernel panic affects the whole system, so the scope is changed.

**S = Changed (C)**

---

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)

- The vulnerability causes a kernel panic (denial of service).
- No indication of information disclosure.

**C = None (N)**

---

### Step 7: Integrity (I)

- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data or code.
- Only crash is observed.

**I = None (N)**

---

### Step 8: Availability (A)

- The kernel panic causes a denial of service.
- Availability is impacted severely.

**A = High (H)**

---

### Final metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via network interface |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to kernel panic affecting entire system |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High availability impact due to kernel panic |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Step 1: Calculate Impact**

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56  
= 4.2112

**Step 2: Calculate Exploitability**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
= approx 3.89

**Step 3: Calculate Base Score**

Since Scope is Changed:

BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))

= 1.08 * (4.2112 + 3.89)  
= 1.08 * 8.1012  
= 8.75

Rounded up to one decimal place: 8.8

- This is a network-based attack, as it involves network protocol messages.
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack requires crafting specific transmit requests with multiple zero-length parts.
- However, the description does not indicate any special conditions or timing requirements.
- The attacker just needs to send malformed packets.
- This is a straightforward attack with low complexity.
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker sends network requests to the Xen virtual network protocol.
- No indication that the attacker needs any privileges on the host or guest.
- Likely no privileges required.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The impact crosses from the network protocol layer to the core networking code, potentially affecting the host or guest OS.
- The description suggests the impact is within the same security scope (the Xen networking subsystem).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference leading to a crash.
- No indication of data disclosure.
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**

- No indication that data can be modified or corrupted.
- The issue causes a crash, not data manipulation.
- **I = None (N)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U):

Base Score = RoundUp(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= RoundUp(Min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= RoundUp(7.4852)

  The vulnerability is in an admin script (`/core/admin/copyfrom.php`), which suggests the attacker might need to be authenticated as an admin or at least logged in. However, the description does not explicitly say that authentication is required.  
  Since it is an admin page, it is likely that some privileges are required.  
  **Value:** Low (L) (assuming attacker needs to be logged in but not admin, or at least some privileges)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  SQL injection vulnerabilities typically do not require user interaction other than the attacker sending crafted requests.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  SQL injection vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL injection can lead to data disclosure. The description does not specify the extent, but SQL injection generally leads to at least some data leakage.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL injection can allow modification of data.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but no indication here.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 8.22 * 0.274 ≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
  Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

  The attacker is remote and anonymous, meaning the attack can be launched over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; buffer overflow exploits are typically straightforward if the vulnerability is present.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is anonymous and remote, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required; the attacker can exploit remotely without user involvement.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The attacker achieves remote code execution as root, which implies the attacker can execute code with elevated privileges on the vulnerable system. This suggests the vulnerability affects components beyond the initially vulnerable component, changing the scope.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Remote code execution as root implies full access to data confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

|----------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N      | Remote attacker over network                                              |

- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability Subscore:**

≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"PyCryptodome and pycryptodomex before 3.19.1 allow side-channel leakage for OAEP decryption, exploitable for a Manger attack."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is a side-channel leakage during OAEP decryption.
- It can be exploited via a Manger attack.
- Side-channel attacks typically require local access or the ability to send crafted inputs to the decryption function.
- PyCryptodome is a cryptographic library, so the attack likely requires the attacker to interact with the decryption function, possibly remotely if the library is used in a networked service.
- The description does not specify that the attacker needs privileges or user interaction.
- The attack is a cryptographic side-channel leakage, which usually affects confidentiality.
- The attack vector is likely Network or Adjacent, depending on how the library is used.
- Since the vulnerability is in a library, the attack vector depends on the context of usage, but generally, cryptographic libraries are used in networked applications, so Network is a reasonable assumption.
- Attack complexity is likely Low because side-channel leakage is exploitable once the attacker can send inputs.
- Privileges Required: None, as the attacker just needs to send crafted ciphertexts.
- User Interaction: None, the attacker can send inputs directly.
- Scope: Unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same component (the library).
- Impact: Confidentiality is High (secret key or plaintext leakage).
- Integrity and Availability are likely None.

---

### Step 2: Assign metric values

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  Because the attacker can send crafted ciphertexts over a network interface using the library.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  The attack is feasible with crafted inputs and no special conditions.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  No privileges needed to send inputs.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  No user interaction required.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same component (the library).

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  Side-channel leakage leads to disclosure of sensitive information.

- **Integrity (I):** None (N)  
  No impact on integrity.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No impact on availability.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(3.60 + 4.37, 10)) = Roundup(7.97) = 8.0

---

### Final summary:

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:N (None)

#####452#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Path Traversal vulnerability in Linea Grafica "Multilingual and Multistore Sitemap Pro - SEO" (lgsitemaps) module for PrestaShop before version 1.6.6, a guest can download personal information without restriction.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows a guest (unauthenticated user) to download personal information. This implies the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description suggests a straightforward path traversal vulnerability that allows direct access to files without restriction. No special conditions or complex steps are mentioned.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is a guest, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly without requiring any user interaction.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to personal information, which is likely outside the security scope of the vulnerable component (the sitemap module). Accessing personal information implies a change in scope because the impact crosses component boundaries.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Personal information is disclosed without restriction, which is a significant confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  There is no indication that the attacker can modify data, only read it.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No impact on availability is described.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | C     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | N     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56 ≈ 4.21

Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
Impact' = 1.08 * (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 * (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 1.08 * (4.21 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (4.21 - 0.02)^15  
The second term is negligible for values > 1, so approximate:  
Impact' ≈ 1.08 * 4.18 ≈ 4.51

**Base Score:**  
= Roundup(min(Impact' + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(min(4.51 + 3.88, 10))  
= Roundup(8.39) = 8.4 → 8.4 rounds to 8.4 (CVSS scores are rounded to one decimal place)

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N**

#####453#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Bref is a serverless PHP runtime on AWS Lambda.
- When used with API Gateway v2 format, it mishandles multiple headers with the same key.
- Only the latest header value is kept.
- This can lower application security if multiple headers are relied upon for security (e.g., multiple Content-Security-Policy headers).
- The vulnerability is patched in version 2.1.13.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The issue arises in a serverless environment (AWS Lambda + API Gateway).
- The vulnerability is in how Bref handles headers in responses.
- The attacker would likely need to send requests through the API Gateway to trigger this behavior.
- Since the API Gateway is accessible over the network, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker needs to send specially crafted requests that cause multiple headers with the same key to be generated.
- This is a straightforward manipulation of HTTP headers.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- Does the attacker need any privileges?
- The attacker can send requests to the API Gateway.
- No indication that authentication or privileges are required.
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- Does the attack require user interaction?
- The attacker sends requests directly to the API Gateway.
- No user interaction needed.
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**

- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?
- The vulnerability causes Bref to mishandle headers, potentially lowering security policies.
- This affects the application’s security posture but does not appear to affect components beyond the Lambda function or API Gateway.
- The impact is within the same security scope (the application).
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Does the vulnerability lead to unauthorized disclosure of information?
- The issue is about headers being overwritten, potentially weakening security policies.
- No direct data leak or confidentiality breach is described.
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- Does the vulnerability allow modification of data?
- The vulnerability causes headers to be overwritten, which can be seen as a modification of security headers.
- This can be considered a **Low (L)** impact on integrity because the attacker can influence the headers sent to clients, potentially bypassing security controls.

**Availability (A):**

- Does the vulnerability affect availability?
- No indication of denial of service or availability impact.
- So, **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack can be performed over the network via API Gateway.                                  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to send requests.                                                  |

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact is within the same security scope.                                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact described.                                                      |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Headers are overwritten, potentially weakening security headers (low integrity impact).    |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact described.                                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (5.3)  
= 5.3

#####454#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
"In video decoder, there is a possible out of bounds read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metric Values

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a video decoder, which typically processes input files locally. The description does not mention remote exploitation or network access.  
  Likely **Local (L)** because the attacker must have local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability (e.g., opening a crafted video file).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The issue is an out of bounds read due to improper input validation, which usually implies low complexity to exploit once the crafted input is provided.  
  So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "no additional execution privileges needed," meaning the attacker does not need any privileges beyond what is required to open the video file.  
  Since the attacker must be local, but no elevated privileges are needed, this is **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker likely needs the user to open or play the crafted video file, which is user interaction.  
  So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) locally, no indication that it affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description mentions an out of bounds read, but no mention of data disclosure. The impact is DoS only.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  The impact is a local denial of service, which affects availability. The description does not specify the severity, but DoS is typically at least Low.  
  Since it is a "possible out of bounds read" leading to DoS, and no indication of complete system crash, assign **Low (L)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access needed to open crafted video file |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to exploit |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must open/play the file |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Denial of service impact on availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 1.85

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22 = 1.32

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 1.85, 10))  
= round_up(3.17) = 3.2

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L**

#####455#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue discovered in TOTOLINK X6000R v9.4.0cu.852_B20230719 allows attackers to run arbitrary commands via the sub_415C80 function."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description does not specify that the attacker needs physical access or adjacency. Since it's a network device (TOTOLINK X6000R is a router), and the vulnerability allows running arbitrary commands, it is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Running arbitrary commands suggests low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges. It says "allows attackers to run arbitrary commands," implying no privileges required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker can run commands directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary commands on the device itself. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Running arbitrary commands can lead to full disclosure of information. This is typically considered a high impact on confidentiality.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary command execution allows modification of data and system state.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can disrupt or deny service.  
  **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085184  
= 0.914816

- Impact (S:U) = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.914816  
= 5.874

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556525  
= 8.22 * 0.473046  
= 3.889

- Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.874 + 3.889, 10))  
= round_up(9.763)  
= 9.8

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####456#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A heap-use-after-free was found in SWFTools v0.9.2, in the function input at lex.swf5.c:2620. It allows an attacker to cause denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a function of SWFTools, which is a software tool. Since it is a heap-use-after-free, it likely requires the attacker to provide a crafted input file or data to the program. This usually means the attacker must have local access or provide a file to the program.  
  SWFTools is typically a local tool (not a network service). So the attack vector is likely **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit if the attacker can control the input. No special conditions or timing are mentioned. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attacker needs to run the program or provide input to it, but no mention of needing elevated privileges, assume **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker must provide crafted input to the program. This is typically considered **None (N)** if the attacker is the one running the program or providing the input directly. If the victim must do something, then UI would be Required. Here, it seems the attacker controls the input, so **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes denial of service (DoS) in the same software process. No indication that it affects other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description only mentions denial of service, no data disclosure. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption beyond DoS. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service is an availability impact. The severity is not specified, but DoS from heap-use-after-free is usually **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on impact. Since it is a crash or DoS, and no indication of complete system shutdown, assume **Low (L)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local tool, attacker must provide input locally |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | Attacker controls input, no user interaction   |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to vulnerable component          |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No data disclosure                              |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                             |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Denial of service, low impact                    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.306  
≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (1.41 + 2.52)  
= Roundup (3.93)  
= 3.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####457#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel smb client code, specifically in `smb2_parse_contexts()`.
- The issue is a potential out-of-bounds (OOB) access due to improper validation of offsets and lengths in SMB2 create contexts.
- This can cause a kernel oops (crash) due to a page fault when accessing invalid create contexts from the server.
- The crash occurs in kernel mode, triggered by malformed data from a remote SMB server.
- The call trace shows this happens during mount operations using CIFS/SMB.
- The vulnerability is fixed by validating offsets and lengths before dereferencing.

---

### Step 1: Determine Attack Vector (AV)

- The vulnerability is triggered by malformed SMB2 create contexts sent by a remote SMB server.
- SMB is a network protocol.
- The attacker can exploit this remotely by sending crafted SMB packets.
- Therefore, **Attack Vector = Network (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Determine Attack Complexity (AC)

- The vulnerability requires sending malformed SMB2 create contexts.
- No indication of special conditions or timing requirements.
- The attacker only needs to send crafted data.
- Therefore, **Attack Complexity = Low (L)**.

---

### Step 3: Determine Privileges Required (PR)

- The vulnerability is triggered by a remote SMB server sending malformed data.
- The vulnerable code is in the client (mount.cifs).
- The attacker is the SMB server, so no privileges on the client are required.
- Therefore, **Privileges Required = None (N)**.

---

### Step 4: Determine User Interaction (UI)

- The vulnerability is triggered by the SMB client processing data from the server.
- No user interaction is required; the client automatically processes the data.
- Therefore, **User Interaction = None (N)**.

---

### Step 5: Determine Scope (S)

- The vulnerability causes a kernel oops (crash) in the Linux kernel.
- The vulnerable component is the kernel.
- The impact is on the kernel, which is a different security authority than the SMB client user space.
- However, the vulnerability is within the kernel itself, so the scope is **Unchanged (U)** because the impact is within the same security scope (kernel).
- Alternatively, one might argue scope changed if the vulnerability affects kernel integrity from user space, but since the attack vector is network and the impact is kernel crash, scope is typically considered **Unchanged (U)** in kernel vulnerabilities.
- **Scope = Unchanged (U)**.

---

### Step 6: Determine Confidentiality (C)

- The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (denial of service).
- No indication that confidentiality of data is compromised.
- Therefore, **Confidentiality = None (N)**.

---

### Step 7: Determine Integrity (I)

- No indication that data is modified or corrupted.
- The vulnerability causes a crash, not data modification.
- Therefore, **Integrity = None (N)**.

---

### Step 8: Determine Availability (A)

- The kernel oops causes a denial of service (crash).
- This impacts availability.
- The impact is significant because the kernel crashes.
- Therefore, **Availability = High (H)**.

---

### Summary of Base Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attacker (SMB server) |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within kernel scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Kernel crash causes high availability impact |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact Subscore + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

#####458#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's usb: mtu3 driver.
- Caused by uninitialized list_head leading to a use-after-free detected by KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer).
- The call trace shows kernel functions involved, indicating this is a kernel-level issue.
- The vulnerability is related to kernel memory corruption (use-after-free).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's USB gadget driver (mtu3).  
- USB devices are typically connected physically or via USB ports, which are local to the machine or adjacent network.  
- However, USB is a physical interface, so exploitation requires physical access to the machine or a device connected via USB.  
- Since the vulnerability is triggered by USB gadget driver code, which is triggered by USB device events, the attacker must have physical access to the machine or USB device.  
- Therefore, **AV: Physical (P)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a use-after-free caused by uninitialized list_head.  
- Exploiting use-after-free in kernel code usually requires precise conditions but no unusual environment or timing constraints are mentioned.  
- However, kernel vulnerabilities often require some complexity to exploit.  
- Given no special conditions are mentioned, and the bug is a straightforward uninitialized pointer leading to use-after-free, the complexity is likely low.  
- **AC: Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel USB gadget driver.  
- To trigger the vulnerability, the attacker likely needs to interact with the USB gadget interface.  
- USB gadget drivers are typically used in device mode, and the attacker might need to be able to connect a USB device or act as a USB device.  
- If the attacker is an external device connecting via USB, no privileges on the host OS are required.  
- So, **PR: None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by USB device events.  
- The attacker controls the USB device, so no user interaction on the host is required.  
- **UI: None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on kernel memory structures.  
- The vulnerability affects kernel memory, which is outside the scope of the USB gadget driver process.  
- Kernel vulnerabilities usually change scope because they affect system-wide resources.  
- **S: Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free in kernel memory can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data leakage, but use-after-free can allow reading or leaking kernel memory.  
- Assume **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can allow modification of kernel memory, leading to integrity loss.  
- Assume **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause kernel crashes (denial of service).  
- Assume **Low (L)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | P     | Physical access via USB required |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions needed |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required on host |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Kernel memory affected, scope changed |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Possible denial of service |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:P (Physical) = 0.2
- AC:L (Low) = 0.77
- PR:N (None) with Scope Changed = 0.85
- UI:N (None) = 0.85
- S:C (Changed)
- C:L (Low) = 0.22
- I:L (Low) = 0.22
- A:L (Low) = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.2 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 0.92

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 7.52 * 0.526 ≈ 3.95

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
= 1.08 * (3.95 + 0.92)  
= 1.08 * 4.87 ≈ 5.26

Rounded to one decimal place: **5.3**

#####459#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### Summary of the vulnerability:

- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's AppArmor module.
- It occurs when processing a packed profile with an empty or malformed profile name (e.g., ":samba-dcerpcd").
- This leads to a null pointer dereference and a kernel crash (general protection fault).
- The crash happens in kernel space due to a NULL profile name.
- The input causing this is passed from userspace.
- The issue results in a denial of service (DoS) via kernel crash.
- The fix denies the profile replacement if the profile name is malformed.

---

### CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is triggered by passing a malformed profile name from userspace.
- The profile replacement is done via a system call (e.g., vfs_write, ksys_write).
- The attacker must have local access to the system to invoke the profile replacement.
- This is not remotely exploitable over the network.
- Therefore, **AV = Local (L)**.

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack requires crafting a specific malformed profile name (e.g., ":samba-dcerpcd").
- This is a straightforward input manipulation.
- No special conditions or race conditions are required.
- Therefore, **AC = Low (L)**.

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be able to replace AppArmor profiles.
- Replacing AppArmor profiles typically requires administrative privileges or CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability.
- So, the attacker needs **High privileges**.
- Therefore, **PR = High (H)**.

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack is performed by the attacker directly invoking the profile replacement.
- No other user interaction is required.
- Therefore, **UI = None (N)**.

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (denial of service).
- The vulnerable component is the kernel (security boundary).
- The crash affects the kernel, which is a different security scope than the user process.
- Therefore, **Scope is Changed (C)**.

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The vulnerability causes a crash, no indication of data disclosure.
- No confidentiality impact.
- Therefore, **C = None (N)**.

---

**Integrity (I):**

- The vulnerability causes a crash, no indication of data modification.
- No integrity impact.
- Therefore, **I = None (N)**.

---

**Availability (A):**

- The kernel crash causes denial of service.
- This is a high impact on availability.
- Therefore, **A = High (H)**.

---

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to replace profile |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward input |
| PR     | H     | High privileges required to replace profile |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Kernel crash affects different security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High impact on availability (kernel crash) |

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 when Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

**Base Score calculation (Scope Changed):**

BaseScore = RoundUp (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= RoundUp (Minimum [4.21 + 0.79, 10])  
= RoundUp (5.0)  
= 5.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Missing Authorization vulnerability in CodePeople WP Time Slots Booking Form. This issue affects WP Time Slots Booking Form: from n/a through 1.1.76."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Missing Authorization** means that the application does not properly check if the user is allowed to perform certain actions.
- This usually allows an attacker to perform actions they should not be able to.
- Since it is a WordPress plugin, it is likely accessible over the network (web).
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.
- The description does not specify if the attacker needs to be authenticated or not.
- The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is not explicitly stated, but missing authorization typically allows unauthorized access or modification.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, accessible over the web.  
- So, **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Missing authorization is usually straightforward to exploit, no special conditions.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not specify if the attacker needs to be logged in or not.  
- Since it is a missing authorization, it often means no privileges are required to exploit.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly, no user interaction needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Missing authorization in a plugin usually affects the same security scope (the WordPress application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Missing authorization can allow unauthorized access to data.  
- Since the description does not specify the extent, assume **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Missing authorization can allow unauthorized modification of data.  
- Assume **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: L (Low)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(6.42)  
= 6.4 (Medium severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Marco Milesi Browser Theme Color. This issue affects Browser Theme Color: from n/a through 1.3.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Vulnerability type:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)  
- **Affected component:** Browser Theme Color extension (likely a browser extension)  
- **Impact:** CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick a user into submitting a request that they did not intend, potentially causing unauthorized actions.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- CSRF attacks are typically executed over the network (via the web).  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the victim to be tricked into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious site).  
- This is a common and straightforward attack method, so the complexity is low.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system; the attack relies on the victim's privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- CSRF requires the user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the browser extension or browser context).  
- No privilege escalation or crossing security boundaries is indicated.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- CSRF typically does not expose confidential information directly.  
- The description does not mention data leakage.  
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- CSRF can cause unauthorized actions, which may modify data or settings.  
- Since it can cause changes, integrity impact is Low (L).  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- A = None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (unauthorized changes) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of:  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else if Scope = Unchanged:  
BaseScore = RoundUp(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= RoundUp(Min(1.41 + 2.82, 10))  
= RoundUp(4.23) = 4.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- RustDesk 1.2.3 on Windows installs a test certificate (WDKTestCert) into Trusted Root Certification Authorities.
- The certificate has Enhanced Key Usage for Code Signing.
- The private key security is unknown and potentially weak.
- If the private key is compromised, arbitrary software could be signed and trusted.
- The certificate installation step is visible to the user and checked by default.
- This behavior is by design (not a vulnerability in the traditional sense, but a security risk).

---

### Metric Analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The issue arises from a default installation on Windows.  
- The attacker would need to compromise the private key of the certificate or trick the user into installing the software.  
- The certificate is installed locally during installation, but the installation can be initiated remotely (e.g., downloading and running the installer).  
- However, the actual exploitation (signing arbitrary software) requires access to the private key, which is not remotely accessible by default.  
- The main risk is misuse of the private key, which is external to the system.  
- The vulnerability itself is about trust in the certificate installed locally.  
- Since the certificate is installed locally, and the user must run the installer, the attack vector is **Local (L)** or possibly **Adjacent (A)** if the attacker can get code running locally.  
- But since the user must run the installer, and the certificate installation is visible, the attacker cannot remotely exploit without user action.  
- **AV = Local (L)**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to obtain the private key of the test certificate, which is presumably not publicly documented but may be weakly protected.  
- This is not trivial but not very complex either, given the certificate is a test cert and may have weak security.  
- The user must also run the installer (user interaction).  
- Overall, the attack complexity is **High (H)** because compromising the private key is not trivial.  
- **AC = High (H)**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To exploit the vulnerability (sign arbitrary software with the private key), the attacker needs the private key, which is external to the system.  
- To install the certificate, the user must run the installer, which requires at least user privileges.  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the victim system to misuse the private key elsewhere.  
- However, the vulnerability is about the trust of the certificate installed locally.  
- Since the attacker needs no privileges on the victim system to misuse the private key (the private key is external), but the user must run the installer, the PR is **None (N)** from the attacker's perspective.  
- **PR = None (N)**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The certificate installation step is visible to the user and checked by default.  
- The user must proceed with the installation for the certificate to be installed.  
- Therefore, user interaction is **Required (R)**.  
- **UI = Required (R)**

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the trust chain of the system by adding a certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities.  
- This affects the system's security environment beyond the vulnerable component (RustDesk).  
- The scope is **Changed (C)** because the trust boundary is extended.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows signing arbitrary software, which can lead to trust in malicious code.  
- It does not directly disclose confidential information.  
- Confidentiality impact is **None (N)**.  
- **C = None (N)**

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can sign arbitrary software, potentially leading to execution of malicious code trusted by the system.  
- This is a **High (H)** impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

---

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85) because Scope is Changed
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.1279 ≈ 1.05

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 1 × 0.44 × 1)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

BaseScore = RoundUp (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

Let's analyze the CVE description for the Apache Commons Compress "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')" vulnerability and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics.

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Infinite loop due to unreachable exit condition.
- Affected software: Apache Commons Compress versions 1.3 through 1.25.0.
- Fixed in version 1.26.0.
- No explicit mention of exploitation complexity, privileges, or user interaction.
- The vulnerability likely causes a denial of service (DoS) by making the application hang or consume resources indefinitely.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Apache Commons Compress is a library used in software, typically processing compressed files. The vulnerability is triggered by processing crafted input files.  
- The attack requires the attacker to supply a crafted compressed file to the application using the library.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely if the application processes untrusted compressed files.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is an infinite loop triggered by crafted input.  
- No special conditions or timing requirements are mentioned.  
- Crafting a malicious compressed file is straightforward for an attacker.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply a crafted compressed file.  
- No privileges on the system or application are required.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must have the victim application process the crafted file.  
- This usually requires the user or system to open or process the file.  
- However, since the application automatically processes the file (e.g., server-side processing), no user interaction is needed beyond the attacker sending the file.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes an infinite loop in the library, which likely affects the application using it.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes an infinite loop, no data disclosure is mentioned.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No modification or corruption of data is described.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The infinite loop causes denial of service by hanging or resource exhaustion.  
- This impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system unavailability.  
- Usually, infinite loops are rated as **High (H)** availability impact because they can cause complete denial of service.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Base Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote attacker supplies crafted file over network |
| AC     | L     | Crafting malicious file is straightforward |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Infinite loop causes high availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6 × 0.56  
= 3.36

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (3.36 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (7.25)  
= 7.3

Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem.
- It involves improper handling of uninitialized stack memory accesses.
- Privileged programs could read uninitialized stack memory inconsistently.
- The patch fixes:
  - Accesses to uninitialized stack slots.
  - Stack size tracking for variable-offset reads.
- The issue could lead to out-of-bounds reads at runtime due to incorrect stack size allocation.
- The vulnerability affects privileged programs (implied by "privileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack memory").
- The problem is in kernel code, so exploitation likely requires local access or at least adjacent network access.
- No mention of user interaction required.
- The impact is on confidentiality (reading uninitialized memory), integrity (potentially reading incorrect data), and availability is not clearly impacted.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (kernel memory).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel BPF subsystem.  
- BPF programs can be loaded locally or via network interfaces, but typically loading BPF programs requires local privileges or at least adjacent network access.  
- Since the description mentions "privileged programs" and stack memory access, this suggests local code execution or local program execution.  
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely over the network without local access.  
- Therefore, **AV:L (Local)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue involves subtle stack size tracking and uninitialized memory access.  
- Exploiting this requires understanding of BPF internals and crafting specific BPF programs.  
- This is not trivial but also not extremely complex for someone with kernel knowledge.  
- The description does not mention any random or timing conditions.  
- So, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "Privileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack memory".  
- This implies that the attacker must have privileges to load or run privileged BPF programs.  
- So, **PR:H (High)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker can exploit this by running privileged BPF programs.  
- So, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel's internal memory handling.  
- However, the impact is on the same security authority (kernel memory).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- So, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows reading uninitialized stack memory, which can leak sensitive information.  
- This is a **High** confidentiality impact because kernel memory leakage can expose sensitive data.  
- So, **C:H (High)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description focuses on reading uninitialized memory, not modifying it.  
- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data.  
- So, **I:N (None)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **A:N (None)**.

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to load/run privileged BPF programs |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | H     | High privileges required (privileged programs) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, kernel memory affected within same security scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact due to kernel memory leak |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55

- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:H = 0.56
- I:N = 0.0
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.2295  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.1767  
= 8.22 * 0.0972  
= approx 0.799

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Deck is a kanban style organization tool integrated with Nextcloud.
- Vulnerability: Users could be tricked into executing malicious code in their browser via HTML sent as a comment.
- This implies a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- No known workarounds.
- The attack involves tricking users into executing malicious code in their browser.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves sending malicious HTML as a comment that is rendered in the user's browser.  
- The attacker can be remote and does not need physical or local access.  
- The attack is likely performed over the network (e.g., submitting a comment via the web interface).  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft malicious HTML and get a user to view it.  
- This is a typical XSS scenario, which usually has low complexity.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can submit a comment that contains malicious HTML.  
- The description does not specify that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, comments require at least some user privileges (e.g., registered user), but the description does not clarify this.  
- Since it says "users could be tricked," it implies the victim is a user, but the attacker might be any user or even unauthenticated.  
- Without explicit info, assume **PR = None (N)** (attacker does not need privileges to submit malicious comment).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must be tricked into executing the malicious code by viewing the comment.  
- This requires user interaction (the user must view the comment).  
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes code execution in the victim's browser, but it does not affect the server or other components beyond the user’s browser.  
- The impact is limited to the same security scope (the user’s browser session).  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive info.  
- The description does not specify data leakage, but typical XSS can lead to at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Assume **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Malicious code execution in the browser can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- Assume **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via web interface |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to submit comment |
| UI     | R     | User must view the malicious comment |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to user’s browser (same scope) |
| C      | L     | Possible data leakage via XSS |
| I      | L     | Possible modification of data or actions |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.84) = Roundup(5.35) = 5.4

#####466#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper input validation in some Intel NUC BIOS firmware may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack requires local access ("via local access").  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No indication of special conditions or complexity; improper input validation usually implies low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "may allow a privileged user" to escalate privileges. So the attacker must already have some privileges (not None). Since it says "privileged user" but not "highly privileged," assume Low privileges required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the attack. Usually BIOS firmware vulnerabilities exploited locally do not require user interaction.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in BIOS firmware, and it allows privilege escalation. Privilege escalation typically means the scope changes from one security authority to another (e.g., from user to system).  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention confidentiality impact. The main impact is privilege escalation, which usually affects integrity and availability more.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Privilege escalation implies the attacker can modify system settings or code, so integrity is impacted.  
  Since it is privilege escalation, assume High impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Privileged user required (low privileges)      |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                    |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Privilege escalation changes scope              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                        |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | High impact due to privilege escalation         |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                           |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.246 (approx)  
= 2.02 (approx)

**Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56  
= 4.21 (approx)

Since Scope is Changed (C),  
**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else,  
BaseScore = round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= round_up (4.21 + 2.02)  
= round_up (6.23)  
= 6.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Use-after-free in netfilter subsystem of Linux kernel.
- Trigger: When the catchall element is garbage-collected during removal of the pipapo set.
- Impact: Use-after-free on NFT_CHAIN or NFT_OBJECT.
- Exploit: Allows a local unprivileged user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to escalate privileges on the system.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker is a local user (not remote).
- The flaw is in the kernel, so the attacker must have local access.
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The flaw requires a specific condition (catchall element garbage collection during pipapo set removal).
- This is a somewhat specific condition but not extremely complex.
- Usually, kernel use-after-free bugs exploited by local users are considered Low complexity if no special conditions or timing are required.
- Given the description, no mention of complex timing or environment.
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is a local unprivileged user **with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability**.
- CAP_NET_ADMIN is a Linux capability that is more privileged than a normal user but less than full root.
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges include privileges that provide basic user-level access but not administrative.
- CAP_NET_ADMIN is a powerful capability, but not full root.
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention of user interaction required.
- The attacker is local and can trigger the flaw.
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation on the system.
- The vulnerability affects kernel objects, and the attacker gains higher privileges.
- This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries.
- Scope = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The description does not mention data disclosure.
- The main impact is privilege escalation.
- Confidentiality impact = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**

- Privilege escalation implies the attacker can modify system state or code.
- Integrity impact = High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- Availability impact = None (N).

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI

≈ 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 1 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

Since Scope is Changed:

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
Impact' = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)) = 4.21 (as above)

Base Score = Round_up (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (4.21 + 1.83) = Round_up (6.04) = 6.1

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Linux kernel's memory deduplication (KSM).
- Side channel attack possible when attacker and victim share the same host.
- Attacker can time unmap operations to infer victim's memory pages.
- Requires attacker and victim to be on the same host.
- Exploitation involves timing measurements (side channel).
- No mention of user interaction.
- Impact is information leakage (confidentiality).
- No direct mention of integrity or availability impact.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be on the same host as the victim.  
- This is not over the network or adjacent network, but local to the host.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires timing measurements and specific conditions (default KSM setting).  
- This suggests some complexity but not extremely high.  
- Side channel attacks generally have higher complexity than trivial exploits.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be on the same host and able to perform timing on memory pages.  
- The description does not specify if root or elevated privileges are needed.  
- Since KSM is a kernel feature and the attacker can time unmap operations, likely the attacker needs at least some privileges to interact with memory management or processes.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say root is required.  
- Assuming the attacker can be an unprivileged user on the same host (typical for side channel attacks in shared environments).  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker performs timing measurements directly.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel memory deduplication mechanism.  
- The attacker can leak information from another process (victim).  
- This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the attacker’s own scope.  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can leak victim's memory pages (information disclosure).  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact because it leaks some information but not full system compromise.  
- No indication of total data disclosure.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the attacker can modify victim data.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning Summary                                  |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Attacker must be on the same host (local).        |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Side channel timing attack with specific conditions. |
| Privileges Required (PR) | L  | Attacker likely needs low privileges on host.     |
| User Interaction (UI) | N     | No user interaction required.                      |
| Scope (S)             | C     | Impact crosses privilege boundaries (kernel to user). |
| Confidentiality (C)   | L     | Partial information disclosure.                    |
| Integrity (I)         | N     | No integrity impact.                                |
| Availability (A)      | N     | No availability impact.                             |

#####469#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the input parameter in eyoucms v.1.6.5 allows a remote attacker to run arbitrary code via crafted URL.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted URL, which means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to send a crafted URL. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit via URL, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, usually the victim must interact (e.g., click a link or visit a page). The description does not explicitly say the attacker can execute code without user interaction. Typically, XSS requires the victim to load the crafted URL.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary code, but it is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, which usually affects the same security scope (the web application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is usually considered a Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, which affects integrity. Usually considered Low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS typically does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote exploit via crafted URL |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (visit URL) |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.34) = 5.3

#####470#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in the Website Builder by SeedProd WordPress plugin.
- Missing capability check in a function allows unauthorized modification of data.
- Affects all versions up to 6.15.21.
- Allows **unauthenticated attackers** to change contents of certain pages (coming-soon, maintenance, login, 404 pages).
- The attack is possible remotely (WordPress plugin, web-based).
- The vulnerability allows modification of data (integrity impact).
- Likely some impact on availability or confidentiality is not explicitly mentioned.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the plugin/WordPress instance).

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely over the web (plugin function accessible via HTTP).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check, which is straightforward to exploit.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is **unauthenticated**, so no privileges are required.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows modification of plugin data/pages within the same WordPress instance.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention any data disclosure or information leak.  
- C = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can modify the contents of pages (coming-soon, maintenance, login, 404 pages).  
- This is a clear integrity impact.  
- Since the attacker can change page contents, this is a **High** impact on integrity.  
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via web plugin |
| AC     | L     | Simple exploit, missing capability check |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required (unauthenticated) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | H     | Attacker can modify page contents |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 0.44 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

#####471#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"A use-after-free issue was addressed with improved memory management. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13.3, macOS Big Sur 11.7.5, macOS Monterey 12.6.4. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability allows an app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.  
- Since an app (local software) exploits this, the attack is likely local, not remote over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Use-after-free vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if the attacker can trigger the condition reliably.  
- Assume AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges."  
- The attacker is an app, so the attacker must already have some level of privileges to run the app.  
- Since the app is local, the attacker likely needs to have user-level privileges to run the app.  
- So, PR = Low (L) (since the attacker needs to run an app, but not necessarily admin/root privileges).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.  
- The app itself exploits the vulnerability.  
- So, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows code execution with kernel privileges, which is a higher privilege level than the app's user privileges.  
- This means the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, Scope = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges can lead to full system compromise, including confidentiality.  
- So, Confidentiality = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Similarly, arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges can fully compromise integrity.  
- Integrity = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Kernel-level code execution can disrupt system availability.  
- Availability = High (H).

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 2.52, 10])  
= Roundup (9.4) = 9.4

#####472#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1 contains a stack overflow via the iptv.stb.port parameter in the function formSetIptv.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered via a parameter (`iptv.stb.port`), which suggests it can be exploited remotely over the network (e.g., via a web interface or network service).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Stack overflow vulnerabilities via a parameter typically require no special conditions beyond sending a crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the parameter is likely accessible without authentication (common for such parameters in routers), assume no privileges required. If authentication was required, it would be mentioned.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Exploiting a stack overflow via a parameter usually does not require user interaction; the attacker sends the malicious input directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Stack overflow in a function handling input can lead to code execution or crash within the same component. Unless the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., kernel or other components), scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stack overflow can lead to information disclosure if exploited, but the description does not mention info leak, only overflow. Assume low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Stack overflow can allow code execution or modification of data, so integrity is impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Stack overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via parameter |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure (low) |
| I      | H     | Possible code/data modification |
| A      | H     | Possible denial of service |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(9.33) = 9.3

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H

#####473#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The Easy Forms for Mailchimp WordPress plugin through 6.8.10 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered_html is disallowed.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It affects the plugin's settings.
- The attacker must be a high privilege user (e.g., admin).
- The attack vector is through the plugin settings, so the attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface.
- The vulnerability allows execution of malicious scripts, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some extent.
- User interaction is not explicitly required beyond the attacker performing the action (admin user).
- Scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (WordPress plugin).

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be an admin user logged into the WordPress backend.  
- This implies **Local (L)** or **Adjacent (A)**?  
- Since the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the admin interface, this is **Adjacent (A)** (within the same network or system boundary).  
- However, WordPress admin interface is typically accessed over the network (HTTP/HTTPS).  
- But since authentication is required, and the attacker must be logged in, the vector is **Adjacent (A)** (not Network) because the attacker must be on the same network or have access to the admin interface.  
- Alternatively, some interpretations consider authenticated web interface attacks as Network (N).  
- According to CVSS guidelines, if the attacker can exploit remotely over the network, AV:N is used.  
- Since WordPress admin is accessed over HTTP(S), and the attacker can be anywhere on the internet if the admin interface is exposed, **AV:N** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to lack of sanitization and escaping.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a high privilege user such as admin.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker performs the action themselves (admin user).  
- No additional user interaction required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the plugin settings within the same security scope (WordPress).  
- No privilege escalation beyond the component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- Since the attacker is already admin, the impact on confidentiality is **Low (L)** (some data could be exposed to attacker-controlled scripts).  
- Alternatively, since the attacker is already admin, confidentiality impact might be considered **None (N)** because the attacker already has full access.  
- However, the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts, potentially affecting other users or sessions.  
- Given the attacker is admin, the confidentiality impact is minimal or none.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute scripts that may modify content or settings.  
- Since the attacker is admin, they already have high privileges.  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to perform actions they already can.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network (admin interface accessible remotely) |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges (admin) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No additional confidentiality impact beyond admin privileges |
| I      | N     | No additional integrity impact beyond admin privileges |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)) = 0

**Base Score =**  
Since Impact = 0, Base Score = 0 (no impact).

---

### Final conclusion:

- The vulnerability requires high privileges and allows XSS, but since the attacker is already admin, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is none.
- Therefore, the CVSS base score is 0.0 (no impact).
- However, some organizations might assign Low impact for XSS even with admin privileges, but per CVSS rules, if no impact beyond existing privileges, impact is None.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"In media service, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local denial of service with System execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description mentions "local denial of service" and "System execution privileges needed." This implies the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV = Local (L)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check, which is typically straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained. No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which means the attacker must already have high-level privileges (system-level).  
  **PR = High (H)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker with system privileges can trigger the vulnerability directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to denial of service locally with system privileges. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description only mentions denial of service, no data disclosure.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service is an availability impact. The description says "local denial of service," so there is some availability impact. Usually, a DoS caused by out-of-bounds write is at least Low impact.  
  **A = Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity exploit |
| PR     | H     | System execution privileges needed |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Local denial of service (availability impact) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 * 0.77 = 3.481  
3.481 * 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 * 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.412

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else: Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.412 + 0.799, 10))  
= round_up(2.211)  
= 2.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####475#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
An improper access control in Fortinet FortiPortal versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.6 and 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 allows an attacker to escalate privileges via specifically crafted HTTP requests.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via HTTP requests, which implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to send crafted HTTP requests. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which implies the attacker must already have some level of access before escalating privileges. Since it is privilege escalation, the attacker likely has Low privileges initially.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Privilege escalation usually means the attacker gains higher privileges within the same security scope (e.g., same application or system). The description does not mention crossing security boundaries or impacting other components.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Privilege escalation often allows access to more sensitive information. Since the description is about privilege escalation, it likely impacts confidentiality to some extent.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  With escalated privileges, the attacker can likely modify data or configurations.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploited remotely via HTTP requests over the network                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Attacker must have some privileges to escalate                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                                              |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Privilege escalation within the same security scope                      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Some sensitive information disclosure possible due to privilege escalation|
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of data or settings                                 |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability mentioned                                      |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.35

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.35 + 2.82) = round_up(5.17) = 5.2 → 5.2 rounds to 5.2 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####476#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel serial driver (8250: omap).
- The issue is that if `pm_runtime_resume_and_get()` fails, resource freeing is skipped.
- This leads to resource leaks.
- Skipping `serial8250_unregister_port()` can keep UART resources around, potentially triggering a use-after-free.
- The fix replaces an error return with a more useful error message and continues cleanup.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a kernel driver related to serial ports (UART).  
- Exploitation likely requires local access to the system (e.g., access to the serial port or device).  
- Not remotely exploitable over the network.  
- Therefore, **AV:L (Local)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue arises from a specific failure in `pm_runtime_resume_and_get()` and skipping resource freeing.  
- Exploiting this likely requires specific conditions (e.g., triggering the failure and use-after-free).  
- This is not trivial but also not very complex.  
- Given the need to trigger a failure and race conditions, **AC:H (High)** is appropriate.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel driver, to interact with the serial port or trigger the failure, some level of privileges is needed.  
- Usually, accessing kernel drivers or triggering such conditions requires at least low privileges (e.g., a local user).  
- So, **PR:L (Low)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel driver and does not require user interaction to exploit once the attacker has local access.  
- So, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects kernel memory and resources.  
- A use-after-free in the kernel can lead to privilege escalation or system compromise, affecting the kernel scope.  
- The impact crosses privilege boundaries (from user to kernel).  
- Therefore, **S:C (Changed)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data leakage, but use-after-free can allow reading kernel memory.  
- So, **C:L (Low)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can allow modification of kernel memory or code execution.  
- This can lead to integrity compromise.  
- So, **I:L (Low)** (since full control is not explicitly stated, but some integrity impact is possible).

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause system crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **A:L (Low)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger the issue |
| AC     | H     | Specific conditions needed, not trivial |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges needed to interact with driver |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses privilege boundaries (kernel scope) |
| C      | L     | Possible information disclosure via use-after-free |
| I      | L     | Possible integrity impact via use-after-free |
| A      | L     | Possible availability impact (crash/DoS) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:H = 0.44
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 1.36

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 7.52 * 0.526 ≈ 3.95

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= 1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)  
= 1.08 * (3.95 + 1.36)  
= 1.08 * 5.31 ≈ 5.73

Rounded to one decimal place: **5.7 (Medium severity)**

#####477#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to race conditions in power domain management (mediatek pmdomain).
- The race condition occurs when power domains are registered and powered on/off concurrently in the probe sequence.
- The fix involves changing the order of operations to avoid race conditions.
- The issue is a race condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior or system instability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's power domain driver code.  
- Exploitation would require interaction with the driver, likely locally on the system (e.g., via a local user or process triggering the probe sequence).  
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely over a network or adjacent network.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a race condition, which typically requires precise timing and conditions to exploit.  
- Race conditions are generally considered to have **High (H)** complexity because exploitation is not straightforward and requires specific conditions.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To trigger the probe sequence and power domain operations, the attacker likely needs some level of privileges on the system.  
- Since this is kernel-level code, normal unprivileged users usually cannot trigger driver probe sequences or power domain operations.  
- Likely requires **High (H)** privileges (e.g., root or kernel-level privileges).  
- So, **High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required for exploitation.  
- The race condition is internal to the kernel driver operations.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel subsystem.  
- The impact is within the kernel itself, not crossing security boundaries to other components.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention any data leakage or confidentiality impact.  
- Race conditions in power management typically do not expose confidential data.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Race conditions can cause unexpected behavior, possibly leading to corruption or incorrect operation.  
- However, no explicit mention of data or code integrity being compromised.  
- The impact might be low-level corruption or instability.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for potential minor integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Race conditions in power management can cause system instability or crashes.  
- This can lead to denial of service or reduced availability.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for potential availability impact.

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact confined to kernel subsystem, no scope change.                                     |

| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible minor integrity impact due to race condition.                                    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:H = 0.44  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.0557 ≈ 0.457

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.515

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.515 + 0.457, 10))  
= round_up(2.972)  
= 3.0 (rounded to one decimal place)

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.318  
= 8.22 * 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in JFinalcms 5.0.0 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the name field when creating a new custom table.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via the "name field" when creating a new custom table. This implies the attacker can send crafted input remotely, likely over the network (e.g., via a web interface).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require low complexity to exploit if no special conditions are needed. The description does not mention any special conditions or complex steps.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker needs to create a new custom table, which suggests some level of privilege (e.g., authenticated user with permission to create tables). This is not "None." It is likely "Low" because the attacker needs some privileges but not administrative.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attacker usually needs a victim to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a page with the injected script). The description says "allows attackers to run arbitrary code," which usually means the victim's browser executes the code. So user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary code in the context of the web application, but it does not mention privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component. Usually, XSS vulnerabilities do not change scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow attackers to modify data or perform actions on behalf of users, so it impacts integrity to some extent.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

| Integrity (I)        | L       | Possible modification of data or actions                                                  |
| Availability (A)     | N       | No impact on availability                                                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Unchanged)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.05) = Roundup(4.56) = 4.6 (Medium)

#####481#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
Dell BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition, versions before 4.1.5, and Dell BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, versions before 4.5.2, contain a Missing Required Cryptographic Step Vulnerability.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is a "Missing Required Cryptographic Step," which typically means a cryptographic operation is incomplete or improperly implemented.
- This kind of vulnerability usually affects the confidentiality and/or integrity of data.
- Since it is a cryptographic library, the attack vector is likely remote (network) because cryptographic libraries are often used in networked applications.
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.
- Privileges required are likely none because cryptographic libraries are used by applications that may be exposed to unprivileged users.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the component itself without impacting other components or privileges.
- The impact is likely on confidentiality and integrity, possibly availability is unaffected.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  Reason: Cryptographic libraries are used in networked applications; attacker can exploit remotely.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Missing cryptographic step is a straightforward flaw; no special conditions needed.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  Reason: No indication that attacker needs privileges.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  Reason: No user interaction mentioned or implied.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  Reason: The vulnerability affects the component itself, no indication of scope change.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  Reason: Missing cryptographic step likely leads to full compromise of confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  Reason: Cryptographic step missing can allow data tampering, so integrity is fully impacted.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  Reason: No indication of availability impact.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |

| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact                           |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936  
= 0.8064

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.8064  
= 5.18

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (5.18 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (9.07)  
= 9.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####482#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Networker 19.9 and prior versions.
- Plain-text password stored temporarily in config file during backup.
- User with low privilege access to Networker Client system can exploit.
- Exploitation leads to disclosure of MySQL database user credentials.
- Attacker can use exposed credentials to access the database with the compromised account's privileges.

---

### Step 1: Attack Vector (AV)
- The attacker needs access to the Networker Client system.
- The description says "User has low privilege access to Networker Client system," implying local access.
- Not network or adjacent network.
- **AV: Local (L)**

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)
- The vulnerability involves reading a temporary config file during backup.
- No special conditions or timing requirements mentioned.
- The attacker just needs low privilege access and to read the file.
- **AC: Low (L)**

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)
- The attacker must have low privilege access to the Networker Client system.
- So, privileges are required but low.
- **PR: Low (L)**

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)
- The attacker is a user with low privilege access.
- No mention of needing another user to perform any action.
- The attacker exploits their own access.
- **UI: None (N)**

### Step 5: Scope (S)
- The vulnerability leads to disclosure of database credentials.
- The attacker uses these credentials to access the database.
- The database is a separate component from the Networker Client system.
- This implies a change in scope because the impact crosses security boundaries (from client system to database).
- **S: Changed (C)**

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)
- Disclosure of database user credentials.
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.
- The attacker gains access to sensitive information.
- **C: High (H)**

### Step 7: Integrity (I)
- The attacker can access the database with the compromised account's privileges.
- The description does not explicitly mention modification of data, but access with credentials implies potential modification.
- However, since the description only mentions disclosure and access, and not explicit modification, we consider at least Low impact on integrity.
- **I: Low (L)**

### Step 8: Availability (A)
- No mention of impact on availability.
- **A: None (N)**

---

### Summary of Metrics:
- AV: L (Local)
- AC: L (Low)
- PR: L (Low)
- UI: N (None)
- S: C (Changed)
- C: H (High)
- I: L (Low)
- A: N (None)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:H = 0.56
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]

= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]

= 7.52 * [1 - 0.44 * 0.78 * 1]

= 7.52 * [1 - 0.3432]

= 7.52 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.94

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0

Else,

Base Score = Roundup (1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability))

= 1.08 * (4.94 + 2.52) = 1.08 * 7.46 = 8.05

Rounded up to one decimal place: 8.1

#####483#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in CubeFS master component (UserService).
- Allows an untrusted attacker to steal user passwords via a timing attack.
- Root cause: raw string comparison of passwords.
- The UserService is instantiated when starting the master server.
- Patched in version 3.3.1.
- No other mitigation besides upgrading.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in the UserService of the master component.
- The UserService is instantiated when starting the server.
- The attacker is "untrusted" and can carry out a timing attack to steal passwords.
- Since the attacker can perform the attack remotely (implied by "untrusted attacker" and no mention of local access), and the UserService is part of the server component, it is likely accessible over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack is a timing attack exploiting raw string comparison.
- Timing attacks generally require precise measurement and conditions, making them more complex than straightforward attacks.
- However, the description does not mention any special conditions or environment constraints.
- Timing attacks are usually considered **High (H)** complexity because they require specific conditions and precision.
- **AC = High (H)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is described as "untrusted," implying no privileges.
- The attacker can steal passwords without any prior authentication.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker carries out a timing attack to steal passwords.
- No mention of needing a user to perform any action.
- The attacker acts independently.
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the UserService component.
- The impact is on confidentiality of user passwords.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.
- The scope remains within the same component.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can steal user passwords.
- This is a direct impact on confidentiality.
- The impact is significant but not necessarily full system compromise.
- Passwords are highly sensitive.
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**

- No mention of modification or corruption of data.
- The attack is about stealing passwords, not changing them.
- **I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible UserService |
| AC     | H     | Timing attack requires precision |
| PR     | N     | Untrusted attacker, no privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same component |
| C      | H     | Passwords stolen, high confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.318  
= 8.22 × 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.5952 + 2.22)  
= Round_up (5.8152)  
= 5.8

#####485#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in open5gs v2.6.6. InitialUEMessage, Registration request sent at a specific time can crash AMF due to incorrect error handling of Nudm_UECM_Registration response."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- The vulnerability is in open5gs, a 5G core network implementation.
- The issue occurs when a Registration request (InitialUEMessage) is sent at a specific time.
- The result is a crash of the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function).
- The cause is incorrect error handling of a Nudm_UECM_Registration response.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves sending a Registration request to the AMF.  
- This is a network-based interaction (the attacker sends a message over the network).  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The request must be sent "at a specific time," implying some timing or environmental condition.  
- This increases complexity beyond just sending a normal request.  
- **AC = High (H)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends a Registration request, which is typically unauthenticated or requires no privileges to initiate.  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted message to the AMF; no user interaction is required.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The crash affects the AMF component.  
- The AMF is a different security authority than the component sending the request (UE or attacker).  
- The vulnerability causes a crash in a different component, potentially affecting other components or services.  
- This suggests the scope is changed.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash, but no mention of data disclosure.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- **I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The crash of AMF causes denial of service, impacting availability.  
- The impact is likely high since AMF is critical.  
- **A = High (H)**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
iGalerie v3.0.22 was discovered to contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the Titre (Title) field in the editing interface.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Vector:** Via the Title field in the editing interface  
- **Effect:** Likely allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link or input that the victim must open or interact with.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., HTTP request).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted input.  
- No special environment or conditions needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the editing interface, which suggests the attacker must have access to the editing interface to inject the payload.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say if the attacker must be authenticated or not.  
- Since it is the "editing interface," it is likely that the attacker needs to be authenticated (have some privileges) to access this interface.  
- Assuming the attacker must be logged in with low privileges to access the editing interface.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Reflected XSS requires the victim to interact with a crafted link or input (e.g., clicking a link).  
- So user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- Reflected XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- Usually, this is considered a Low impact on confidentiality because it depends on the victim's interaction and the attacker's ability to exploit the script.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is generally considered Low impact on integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via HTTP |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (authenticated user) |
| UI     | R     | Requires user interaction (victim clicks link) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged (same security domain) |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact (data theft possible) |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (actions on behalf of user) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of:  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else if Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 2.51 + 2.05 = 4.56 → 4.6

- Affected software: Apache Tomcat versions 8.5.7 through 8.5.63, and 9.0.0-M11 through 9.0.43.  
- Recommendation: Upgrade to fixed versions.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves error messages generated by the server.  
- Typically, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely by sending crafted requests to the server.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is about error messages leaking sensitive info.  
- Usually, this does not require special conditions or complex steps beyond sending crafted input.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges to trigger the error message.  
- Likely, no authentication or privileges are required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends requests to the server; no user interaction is needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is about information disclosure within the same component (Apache Tomcat).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability leaks sensitive information via error messages.  
- This is an information disclosure issue.  
- The impact is likely **Low (L)** because it leaks some sensitive info but not full system compromise.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:N (0.00)  

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 1 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

- Impact Sub-Score = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.4124

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5563  
= 8.22 * 0.472  
= approx 3.88

- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Sub-Score + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.4124 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(5.2924)  
= 5.3

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability  
- **Component:** sip_subscribe_remove function in media-server  
- **Version:** v1.0.0  
- **Impact:** UAF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a crash (denial of service), or potentially escalate privileges depending on context.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since this is a media server and the vulnerability is in a SIP-related function (sip_subscribe_remove), it is likely exploitable remotely over the network (SIP is a network protocol).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- UAF vulnerabilities usually require precise conditions but often can be exploited reliably if the attacker can send crafted SIP messages.  
- No mention of special conditions or environment constraints.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges to send SIP messages to the media server.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted SIP messages directly to the server; no user interaction is needed.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- UAF vulnerabilities often allow code execution or memory corruption within the same component.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., no privilege escalation to other components or systems).  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- UAF can lead to information disclosure if memory is read.  
- Likely some information disclosure possible but not full system compromise.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.91, 10)) = round_up(6.42) = 6.4

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **6.4**.

#####491#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM Storage Fusion HCI versions 2.1.0 through 2.6.1 contain hard-coded credentials (password or cryptographic key) used for inbound authentication, outbound communication, or encryption of internal data.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves hard-coded credentials used for inbound authentication and outbound communication.  
- Since the credentials are used for inbound authentication, an attacker can likely exploit this remotely over a network.  
- Therefore, **AV = Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Hard-coded credentials typically allow straightforward exploitation without special conditions.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- Therefore, **AC = Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker exploits hard-coded credentials to authenticate or communicate.  
- Since the credentials are hard-coded and used for inbound authentication, the attacker likely does **not** need any privileges beforehand.  
- Therefore, **PR = None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Exploiting hard-coded credentials usually does not require user interaction.  
- The attacker can authenticate or communicate directly using the credentials.  
- Therefore, **UI = None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects authentication and communication within the product.  
- The description mentions "inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data."  
- If the vulnerability allows an attacker to affect components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope (e.g., external components), the scope might be changed.  
- However, the description does not explicitly state that the attacker can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component's security authority.  
- Given the uncertainty, but considering outbound communication to external components is affected, it is reasonable to assume **Scope = Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Hard-coded credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or encryption keys.  
- This can lead to a **High (H)** impact on confidentiality because the attacker can potentially decrypt or access sensitive data.  
- Therefore, **C = High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Using hard-coded credentials for authentication or communication can allow an attacker to modify data or commands.  
- This suggests a **High (H)** impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, **I = High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- Therefore, **A = None (N)**.

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 3.88, 10)) = round_up(7.48) = 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- Affected product: WPCS – WordPress Currency Switcher Professional (up to version 1.2.0)  
- Impact: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation allows stored XSS.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Stored XSS typically can be exploited remotely by sending malicious input that is stored and later rendered in a web page.  
- The attacker can exploit this over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.  
- No unusual or complex conditions are needed.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated users submitting input (e.g., via comment forms or other input fields).  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For stored XSS, the victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the exploit to succeed.  
- This means user interaction is required (the victim must load the page).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- The vulnerability does not escalate privileges or affect other components beyond the vulnerable web app.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A = None (N)

| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                                                      |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | Victim must load the malicious page                                       |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (e.g., cookie theft)                      |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Partial integrity impact (e.g., script execution/modification)            |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A memory leak issue discovered in parseSWF_DEFINEBUTTON in libming v0.4.8 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted SWF file.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Memory leak leading to denial of service (DoS).
- **Impact:** Denial of service (availability impact).
- **Attack vector:** Via a crafted SWF file, so likely remote/network.
- **Privileges required:** Not specified, but since it's a crafted file, likely no privileges required.
- **User interaction:** The attacker sends a crafted file; user likely needs to open or process the file.
- **Scope:** Not specified, but usually memory leak in a library affects the same component (unchanged).
- **Confidentiality and Integrity:** No mention of data disclosure or modification, so likely none.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker can send a crafted SWF file remotely. So, **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No special conditions mentioned, just a crafted file. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  No mention of needing privileges. The attacker just needs to send a crafted file. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must open or process the crafted SWF file for the vulnerability to be triggered. So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same component (libming). No indication that it affects other components or privileges. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No data disclosure mentioned. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No data modification mentioned. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service via memory leak. This is a **Low (L)** or **High (H)** impact depending on severity. Memory leak usually causes resource exhaustion but not complete crash. However, since it causes DoS, and no indication of total outage, **Low (L)** is appropriate.

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 2.68)  
= Round_up (4.09) = 4.1

#####495#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
DOM-based Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in 'Tail Event Logs' functionality in Nagios Nagios Cross-Platform Agent (NCPA) before 2.4.0 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the name element when filtering for a log.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a network-facing agent (Nagios NCPA).  
- The attacker exploits the 'name' element when filtering logs, which suggests remote exploitation over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- DOM-based XSS usually requires some user interaction or specific conditions but generally is straightforward if the attacker can control input.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker exploits the 'name' element when filtering logs.  
- Usually, filtering logs is a functionality available to authenticated users, but the description does not specify that authentication is required.  
- Since it is an agent, and the vulnerability allows running arbitrary code, it is likely that no privileges are required to exploit this.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- DOM-based XSS typically requires the victim to interact with a crafted link or page to trigger the vulnerability.  
- The attacker runs arbitrary code via the name element, which suggests the victim must interact with the malicious input.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows running arbitrary code via XSS in the agent's web interface.  
- The impact is on the same component (the web interface of the agent).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the user.  
- Since arbitrary code can be run, it can lead to at least some data disclosure.  
- Usually, XSS is rated as Low (L) for confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution via XSS can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies at least Low (L) integrity impact.  
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not impact availability directly.  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.69

**Impact:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.69, 10))  
= round_up(5.20)  
= 5.2 → 5.2 rounds to 5.2 (CVSS scores are rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The vulnerability is in quic-go, a QUIC protocol implementation.
- An attacker can cause the peer to run out of memory by sending many PATH_CHALLENGE frames.
- The attacker manipulates the peer's congestion window and RTT estimate to prevent PATH_RESPONSE frames.
- This is a denial-of-service (DoS) type attack causing resource exhaustion (memory).
- The attack involves sending network packets (PATH_CHALLENGE frames).
- No mention of needing privileges or user interaction.
- The impact is primarily on availability (memory exhaustion).
- No indication of confidentiality or integrity impact.
- The scope likely remains unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same component (the peer).

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends frames over the network to the peer.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must send a large number of PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulate congestion window and RTT estimates.  
- This requires some effort but no special conditions beyond network access.  
- The complexity is not trivial but also not high; however, manipulating congestion window and RTT suggests some complexity.  
- AC = Low (L) or High (H)?  
- Given the need to manipulate congestion window and RTT, which is somewhat complex, AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the target system.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No user interaction is required; the attacker sends frames directly.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (the peer) and does not affect other components or security authorities.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No confidentiality impact is described.  
- C = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No integrity impact is described.  
- I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- The attack causes the peer to run out of memory, leading to denial of service.  
- This is a high impact on availability.  
- A = High (H).

### Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.2709  
≈ 2.226

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 * 1 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

**Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged):**  
= 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
= Roundup(Min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(Min(3.5952 + 2.226, 10))  
= Roundup(5.8212)

#####498#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in OpenNDS before 10.1.3. It fails to sanitize the status path script entry in the configuration file, allowing attackers that have direct or indirect access to this file to execute arbitrary OS commands."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of a configuration file entry.
- Attackers who have direct or indirect access to this configuration file can execute arbitrary OS commands.
- The key phrase is "attackers that have direct or indirect access to this file," implying some level of access is required.
- The attack vector is through the configuration file, not over the network directly.
- The impact is arbitrary OS command execution, which typically affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability at a high level.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must have access to the configuration file.  
- This is not a network attack (N) because the attacker must have access to a local file.  
- Is it Adjacent (A)? Adjacent means the attacker is on the same shared physical or logical network. This is not a network-based attack.  
- Local (L) means the attacker must have local access to the system or file.  
- Physical (P) means physical interaction is required, which is not the case here.  
**Conclusion:** AV:L (Local)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to have access to the configuration file and exploit the unsanitized input.  
- No mention of any special conditions or timing required.  
- The complexity is low because once access to the file is obtained, exploitation is straightforward.  
**Conclusion:** AC:L (Low)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have access to the configuration file.  
- Access to configuration files usually requires some privileges, but the description says "direct or indirect access," which could mean the attacker already has some level of access.  
- Since the attacker needs to modify or control the configuration file, this implies at least low privileges.  
- If the attacker had no privileges, they wouldn't have access to the file.  
**Conclusion:** PR:L (Low)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required for exploitation.  
- The attacker can execute arbitrary commands once they have access to the file.  
**Conclusion:** UI:N (None)

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary OS commands.  
- This likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., the OS).  
- Therefore, the scope is changed.  
**Conclusion:** S:C (Changed)

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can lead to full disclosure of information.  
- High impact on confidentiality.  
**Conclusion:** C:H (High)

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution allows modification of data and system files.  
- High impact on integrity.  
**Conclusion:** I:H (High)

---

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., delete files, stop services).  
- High impact on availability.  
**Conclusion:** A:H (High)

### Step 4: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with these values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation (approximate):**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.25

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 × (Impact Subscore - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact Subscore - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.886 - 3.25 × (0.895)^15  
= 6.66 - 3.25 × 0.142  
= 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

- Base Score = Round up (minimum of (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
= 6.20 + 2.25 = 8.45 → 8.5 (rounded to one decimal)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An authentication bypass vulnerability in the web component of Ivanti ICS 9.x, 22.x and Ivanti Policy Secure allows a remote attacker to access restricted resources by bypassing control checks."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a web component and can be exploited remotely.  
  → **Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; authentication bypass usually implies low complexity.  
  → **Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and can bypass authentication, implying no privileges are required to exploit.  
  → **None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of needing user interaction; the attacker can directly exploit the vulnerability.  
  → **None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to restricted resources within the same component or system. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  → **Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Bypassing authentication to access restricted resources implies some confidentiality impact. Since the attacker can access restricted data, but the description does not specify full data disclosure, assume **Low (L)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description does not mention modification of data, only bypassing access controls.  
  → **None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of impact on availability.  
  → **None (N)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability sub-score:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact sub-score:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 1 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.89 + 1.41)  
= Round_up (5.30)  
= 5.3

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N**

#####500#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- The vulnerability is in the WiX toolset installer framework.  
- The issue involves the ".be TEMP folder" being vulnerable to DLL redirection attacks.  
- This allows an attacker to escalate privileges.  
- The impact is on any installer built with WiX.  
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 4.0.4.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves DLL redirection via a TEMP folder.  
- DLL redirection typically requires the attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it.  
- Since this is related to the TEMP folder and installer execution, the attacker likely needs local access to the system or the ability to write to the TEMP folder.  
- This is not a remote network attack.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- DLL redirection attacks require some conditions, such as placing a DLL in a specific folder and triggering the installer.  
- This is not trivial but also not highly complex.  
- However, since the attacker must place a DLL in the TEMP folder and trigger the installer, and the conditions are somewhat specific, the complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is escalating privileges, so initially, they have some privileges.  
- To write to the TEMP folder, the attacker must have some level of access.  
- The TEMP folder is typically writable by the user running the installer.  
- If the attacker is a normal user, they can write to their own TEMP folder.  
- But if the installer runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can escalate.  
- So, the attacker requires **Low (L)** privileges (normal user) to exploit.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker needs to trigger the installer or the installation process.  
- This likely requires the user to run the installer or some action to start the process.  
- So, **User Interaction Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, meaning the impact crosses from the attacker's scope (user) to a higher scope (system or admin).  
- This means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions privilege escalation but does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
- However, privilege escalation can lead to high confidentiality impact.  
- Since the attacker gains higher privileges, they can access confidential data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Privilege escalation allows the attacker to modify system files or settings.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention availability impact.  
- Privilege escalation may allow denial of service, but it's not explicit.  
- So, **None (N)**.

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: L (Local)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: L (Low)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)

#####501#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary content of the results database via a crafted HTTP request."

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and uses an HTTP request, which is over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just sends a crafted HTTP request. This implies low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request directly; no user interaction is needed.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary content of the results database. The database is likely part of the same security authority as the vulnerable component (no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope).  
  Therefore, scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can read arbitrary content of the results database, which is a clear confidentiality impact. Since the attacker can read arbitrary content, this is a **High (H)** impact on confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description only mentions reading data, no modification.  
  **Integrity = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of disruption or denial of service.  
  **Availability = None (N)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= Roundup(7.4852)  
= 7.5

#####502#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- Affected product: WordPress plugin "Auto Listings – Car Listings & Car Dealership"  
- Versions affected: up to 2.6.5  
- Impact: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of users visiting the affected pages.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Stored XSS in a web plugin is typically exploitable remotely over the network by sending crafted input that is stored and later executed in a victim's browser.  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond submitting crafted input that is stored and later rendered. No complex conditions or timing required.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
Does the attacker need any privileges on the system? Usually, for stored XSS in a WordPress plugin, the attacker can be an unauthenticated user submitting input (e.g., via a form or comment). The description does not specify any authentication requirement.  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
Does the attack require the victim to interact? Yes, the victim must visit the page containing the stored malicious script for the XSS to execute.  
- UI: Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component? Stored XSS affects the security context of the victim's browser, but the vulnerability is within the same security scope (the web application). The impact is on the same scope (the web app).  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser. This is a significant confidentiality impact but not total system compromise.  
- C: Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
Stored XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content seen by the user, potentially altering displayed information. This is a low integrity impact.  
- I: Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
Stored XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A: None (N)

- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1:**  
Base Score = Roundup (Impact + Exploitability) = Roundup (2.51 + 2.68) = Roundup (5.19) = 5.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The EventON WordPress plugin before 4.5.5, EventON WordPress plugin before 2.2.7 do not have authorisation in an AJAX action, allowing unauthenticated users to retrieve email addresses of any users on the blog.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via an AJAX action, which is a web request. This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to send a request.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "unauthenticated," meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated and can directly exploit the vulnerability; no user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to email addresses of users on the blog. This is a data disclosure within the same component (plugin/WordPress). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Email addresses are considered sensitive information. The attacker can retrieve email addresses of any users, which is a partial disclosure of sensitive information. This is typically rated as Low impact on confidentiality (not High, since it is not full system compromise or secret keys).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(1.41 + 3.91, 10)) = Roundup(5.32) = 5.3

According to CVSS v3.1 scoring, a score of 5.3 is Medium severity.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in beetl-bbs 2.0 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the post/save content parameter.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** Allows attackers to run arbitrary code (likely JavaScript) in the context of the victim's browser.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since it's a web application vulnerability and the attacker can exploit it remotely by sending crafted content, the attack vector is likely **Network (N)**.  
- **Attack Complexity:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities are straightforward to exploit if the attacker can control the input. So, **Low (L)**.  
- **Privileges Required:** The attacker likely does not need any privileges to submit content (post/save content parameter). So, **None (N)**.  
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the page containing the stored XSS payload for the code to execute. So, **Required (R)**.  
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the web application and the impact is on the victim's browser (client-side). The vulnerability does not escalate privileges or affect other components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. Usually, XSS is considered **Scope Unchanged (U)** because the impact is within the same security scope (the web app).  
- **Confidentiality:** XSS can lead to data theft (cookies, session tokens), so **Low (L)** or **High (H)**? Usually, XSS is rated **Low (L)** because it depends on the victim's interaction and the data exposed.  
- **Integrity:** XSS can allow attackers to modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, so **Low (L)**.  
- **Availability:** Usually, XSS does not affect availability, so **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Assign metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network (web).                                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required to exploit.                                               |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed to submit malicious content.                                        |
| User Interaction (UI) | R     | Victim must view the stored malicious content.                                           |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact is within the same security scope (web app).                                      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible data theft but limited to victim's data.                                        |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible unauthorized actions or data modification via script execution.                 |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability.                                                               |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.33) = 5.3

---

### Final summary:

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

#####505#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
"Missing Integrity Check in Shelly TRV 20220811-152343/v2.1.8 allows malicious users to create a backdoor by redirecting the device to an attacker-controlled machine which serves the manipulated firmware file. The device is updated with the manipulated firmware."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker redirects the device to an attacker-controlled machine over the network.  
- The attack does not require physical access or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must be able to redirect the device to an attacker-controlled server. This might require some network control or DNS spoofing, but no special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
- Redirecting firmware update requests is generally not complex if the attacker can control the network or DNS.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is described as a "malicious user" who can redirect the device to an attacker-controlled machine.  
- No mention of needing any privileges on the device itself.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The device automatically updates firmware from the redirected source.  
- No user interaction is mentioned or implied.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to install manipulated firmware, effectively compromising the device's software and potentially its security boundaries.  
- This likely changes the scope because the attacker can affect components beyond the initially vulnerable component (the update mechanism).  
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Installing a backdoor can lead to full compromise of the device, including access to confidential information.  
- Therefore, confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can install manipulated firmware, which is a complete integrity compromise.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Installing manipulated firmware could disrupt device operation or cause denial of service.  
- Availability impact is High (H).

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required; attacker can redirect firmware update.                     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed on the device.                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |
| Scope (S)            | C      | The attack affects components beyond the vulnerable component (firmware and device).      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Full compromise of confidentiality due to backdoor installation.                          |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Full compromise of integrity due to manipulated firmware installation.                     |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Full compromise of availability due to potential device disruption.                       |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact sub-score (Scope Unchanged):

ImpactScore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

BaseScore = round_up(min(ImpactScore + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.77)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####507#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in Regify Regipay Client for Windows version 4.5.1.0 allows DLL hijacking: a user can trigger the execution of arbitrary code every time the product is executed."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- DLL hijacking typically requires the attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will load it.  
- This usually requires local access to the system or user environment (e.g., user directory or application directory).  
- The description says "a user can trigger the execution," implying local user interaction.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- DLL hijacking usually requires some knowledge of the application’s DLL loading behavior but is generally straightforward once understood.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "a user can trigger," implying no elevated privileges are needed.  
- The attacker can be a normal user.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must execute the product, which triggers the code execution.  
- The description implies the user must run the application, so user interaction is required.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- DLL hijacking typically affects the application process itself, not other system components.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the application).  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can lead to full control of the application, potentially exposing sensitive data.  
- This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data and code.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the application or system.  
- So, **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local access to place malicious DLL   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward DLL hijacking                   |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must execute the application               |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the application scope         |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Arbitrary code execution compromises confidentiality |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Arbitrary code execution compromises integrity  |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Arbitrary code execution compromises availability|

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score (optional check)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with these values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 1.85

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 = 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 1.85, 10)) = round_up(7.73) = 7.7 → 8.0 (rounded to one decimal)

#####508#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds memory read due to integer underflow in the Linux Kernel SMB Client.  
- Impact: Denial of Service (DoS).  
- Location: `fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c` in the SMB Client sub-component of the Linux Kernel.  
- Cause: Integer underflow on memcpy length.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the SMB Client, which communicates over the network.  
- An attacker can likely exploit this remotely by sending crafted SMB packets.  
- Therefore, **AV = Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The flaw is an integer underflow leading to out-of-bounds read and DoS.  
- No special conditions or timing required are mentioned.  
- This suggests a straightforward exploit.  
- Therefore, **AC = Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a client-side vulnerability triggered by receiving malformed SMB packets, the attacker likely does not need any privileges on the target system.  
- Therefore, **PR = None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by the SMB client receiving malformed data.  
- No user interaction is required for the client to process SMB packets.  
- Therefore, **UI = None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a denial of service in the SMB Client sub-component of the Linux Kernel.  
- The impact is on the same security scope (kernel component).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **S = Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, but the description only mentions denial of service, not information disclosure.  
- Therefore, **C = None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data integrity is affected.  
- The issue causes DoS, not data modification.  
- Therefore, **I = None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability leads to denial of service.  
- This impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system destruction.  
- For kernel DoS, usually **High (H)** is appropriate.  
- Therefore, **A = High (H)**.

| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service impact on availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:H (0.56)  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.485)  
= 7.5

#####509#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"The secret value used for access to critical UDS services of the MIB3 infotainment is hardcoded in the firmware. Vulnerability discovered on Škoda Superb III (3V3) - 2.0 TDI manufactured in 2022."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- The secret value is **hardcoded** in the firmware.
- This secret grants access to **critical UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services)** services.
- The affected system is the **MIB3 infotainment** system in a vehicle.
- The vulnerability is in the firmware of a vehicle infotainment system.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the firmware of the infotainment system.  
- Access to the UDS services is typically possible via the vehicle's internal network or possibly via external interfaces like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or USB.  
- Since the description does not specify that the attacker must be physically present, and infotainment systems often have network interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi), the attack vector is likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The secret is hardcoded, meaning no complex conditions or environment are needed to exploit it.  
- Exploiting the vulnerability is straightforward once the attacker can communicate with the system.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The secret is used to access critical UDS services.  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any prior privileges to exploit the vulnerability.  
- If the attacker can communicate with the infotainment system (e.g., via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi), no privileges are required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention that user interaction is required.  
- Exploiting a hardcoded secret typically does not require user interaction.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the infotainment system firmware.  
- If the exploit affects other components beyond the infotainment system (e.g., vehicle control systems), scope would be Changed (C).  
- The description only mentions access to critical UDS services of the infotainment system, not other vehicle systems.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The secret is hardcoded and can be extracted or used to access critical services.  
- This leads to a **High (H)** confidentiality impact because the attacker gains access to secret information.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Access to critical UDS services likely allows the attacker to modify data or settings.  
- This implies a **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- However, access to critical services could potentially disrupt availability, but since it's not explicitly stated, we assume **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 3.87, 10))  
= round_up(9.05) = 9.1

#####510#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Automattic, Inc. Crowdsignal Dashboard – Polls, Surveys & more allows Reflected XSS.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link to the victim, and the victim must visit the link. The attack is performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond the victim clicking a malicious link. This is considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system to exploit reflected XSS.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must click or visit a malicious link for the attack to succeed. This means user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Reflected XSS typically affects the same security scope (same origin) and does not impact other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the user, so confidentiality impact is Low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can inject scripts that may modify the content seen by the user, potentially misleading or altering displayed information. This is a Low impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize Metric Values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.35

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(2.35 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.17) = 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####511#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The Wp-Adv-Quiz WordPress plugin through 1.0.2 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It requires a **high privilege user** (e.g., admin) to exploit.
- The attack vector is through the plugin settings, which implies the attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface.
- The vulnerability allows stored XSS, which can impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability of other users' sessions or data.
- The attack requires the attacker to be a high privilege user (admin).
- User interaction is not explicitly required beyond the attacker performing the action (the attacker is the admin user).
- Scope: The vulnerability affects the plugin and potentially other users (e.g., other users' browsers when they view the stored malicious content). This suggests the scope might be changed.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must be logged in as an admin and access the plugin settings. This is a local action within the application, not remotely exploitable by an unauthenticated user. However, since the attacker can perform the attack through the web interface, and the attacker is a user with admin privileges, the vector is **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)**?  
  - Network (N) is for remote attacks over the network without authentication.  
  - Adjacent (A) is for attacks from the same shared physical or logical network.  
  - Local (L) is for attacks requiring local system access (e.g., shell access).  
  Here, the attacker is an authenticated admin user interacting with the web interface. This is typically considered **Adjacent (A)** because the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the application locally (via the web interface).  
  However, CVSS guidance often treats web application attacks requiring authentication as **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)** depending on context. Since the attacker must be logged in, but the attack is through the web interface, **Adjacent (A)** is appropriate.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack requires the attacker to have high privileges and knowledge of the plugin settings. No special conditions or timing are required. The complexity is **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be a high privilege user (admin). So, **High (H)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is the admin user performing the attack. No other user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit. However, the impact of the stored XSS is on other users who view the stored content. But UI metric refers to the attacker’s need for interaction, not the victim’s. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The stored XSS allows impact beyond the vulnerable component (plugin) to other users (e.g., other users' browsers). This means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Stored XSS can allow an attacker to modify content or perform actions on behalf of other users. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability directly, but in some cases, it can cause denial of service or disruption. Since the description does not mention availability impact, assign **None (N)**.

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Requires authenticated admin user interacting with the web interface (adjacent). |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward exploitation. |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges (admin). |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond attacker’s own actions. |
| S      | C     | Impact extends beyond the vulnerable component to other users. |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact due to potential data theft. |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to possible content manipulation. |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned. |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

#####512#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
FPE in paddle.linalg.eig in PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0. This flaw can cause a runtime crash and a denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **FPE**: Floating Point Exception, which leads to a runtime crash.
- **Affected component**: paddle.linalg.eig function in PaddlePaddle.
- **Impact**: Runtime crash and denial of service (DoS).

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**  
   - The vulnerability is in a software library function (paddle.linalg.eig).  
   - Typically, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the function can be triggered via network input or local if it requires local access.  
   - PaddlePaddle is a machine learning framework, often used in environments where code execution is local or via APIs.  
   - Since the description does not specify remote exploitation, but this is a function in a library, it is likely exploitable by an attacker who can supply input to the function.  
   - If the function is used in a server or service accessible over the network, AV:N (Network) applies.  
   - If the function is only exploitable locally, AV:L (Local) applies.  
   - Given the lack of explicit network context, but considering typical usage, **AV:L (Local)** is the most reasonable assumption.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**  
   - Is the attack straightforward or requires special conditions?  
   - The description says "FPE can cause a runtime crash," which suggests a straightforward input causing a crash.  
   - No mention of special conditions or timing.  
   - Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**  
   - Does the attacker need privileges?  
   - Since the function is in a library, the attacker likely needs to execute code that calls this function.  
   - If the attacker can run code that calls this function, they have at least low privileges.  
   - If the attacker can run arbitrary code, PR:N (None) applies.  
   - If the attacker must be a user with some privileges, PR:L (Low).  
   - Since the function is called by code, and the attacker must supply input to it, but no mention of needing elevated privileges, **PR:N (None)** is reasonable.

4. **User Interaction (UI)**  
   - Does the attack require user interaction?  
   - No mention of user interaction.  
   - The attacker triggers the flaw by supplying input to the function.  
   - So, **UI:N (None)**.

5. **Scope (S)**  
   - Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
   - The flaw causes a runtime crash and denial of service.  
   - No indication that it affects other components or privileges beyond the vulnerable component.  
   - So, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C)**  
   - Does the flaw impact confidentiality?  
   - No mention of data leakage or confidentiality impact.  
   - So, **C:N (None)**.

7. **Integrity (I)**  
   - Does the flaw impact integrity?  
   - No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
   - So, **I:N (None)**.

8. **Availability (A)**  
   - The flaw causes a runtime crash and denial of service.  
   - This impacts availability.  
   - The impact is a crash, which is a high impact on availability.  
   - So, **A:H (High)**.

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger the function. |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward crash. |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to trigger. |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required. |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, impact limited to vulnerable component. |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact. |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact. |
| A      | H     | High impact on availability (DoS). |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:N = 0.00
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 2.52, 10))  
= round_up(6.11) = 6.1

#####513#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files under the context of the application OS user (“root”) via a crafted HTTP request."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and uses a crafted HTTP request. This implies the attack is over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. The attacker just sends a crafted HTTP request. This suggests low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request directly; no user interaction is needed.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows reading files under the context of the application OS user ("root"). The impact is on the same security scope (the application OS user). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can read arbitrary files, which is a clear confidentiality impact. Since the attacker can read files as root, this is a high confidentiality impact.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description only mentions reading files, no modification.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.86

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44) = 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.86, 10)) = round_up(7.4552) = 7.5

#####514#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
OneBlog v2.3.4 was discovered to contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the Privilege Management module.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Vulnerability type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Affected component:** Privilege Management module of OneBlog v2.3.4  
- **Impact:** XSS typically allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other client-side impacts.

---

### Step 2: Determine CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable remotely via the web interface.  
- The attacker can send a crafted request over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending malicious input that gets stored and later executed.  
- No special timing or conditions needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Privilege Management module, but the description does not specify that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Usually, stored XSS can be exploited by unauthenticated users if the input is accepted from anyone.  
- Since it is not specified, assume no privileges required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For XSS, the victim must interact by visiting the page where the malicious script is stored.  
- So, user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS affects the client (browser) and not the server or other components.  
- The vulnerability does not impact resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Scope remains unchanged.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim's browser (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to modify data in the victim's browser context (e.g., modify displayed content).  
- This is typically Low impact on integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability of the system.  
- **Value:** None (N)

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable over network                        |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required                           |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | Victim must visit malicious page                |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects only the vulnerable component |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Some data disclosure possible                    |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Some data modification possible                   |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                         |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.19) = 5.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Product: LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v031
- Vulnerability: Observable Response Discrepancy at certain API endpoints and login endpoint
- Impact: The web application provides different responses revealing internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside the intended control sphere.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is exploitable via web application endpoints (`/api/v1/...` and `/login`).
- The attacker can send requests over the network.
- Therefore, **AV = Network (N)**.

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The description suggests the attacker can observe different responses to crafted requests.
- No special conditions or environment requirements are mentioned.
- This implies low complexity.
- Therefore, **AC = Low (L)**.

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is described as "unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere."
- This means no privileges are required.
- Therefore, **PR = None (N)**.

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends requests directly to the endpoints.
- No mention of needing another user to perform any action.
- Therefore, **UI = None (N)**.

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability reveals internal state information.
- However, it does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.
- The impact is on the same component (web application).
- Therefore, **Scope = Unchanged (U)**.

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The vulnerability reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor.
- This is an information disclosure.
- The description does not specify the sensitivity or volume of data, but it is more than none.
- Usually, such information disclosure is considered **Low (L)** unless it is highly sensitive.
- Therefore, **C = Low (L)**.

---

**Integrity (I):**

- No mention of modification or corruption of data.
- Therefore, **I = None (N)**.

---

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of disruption or denial of service.
- Therefore, **A = None (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Base Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible via web endpoints |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable component |
| C      | L     | Information disclosure of internal state |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**

= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**

= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score =**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.88, 10)) = round_up(5.29) = 5.3

#####516#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
In D-LINK Go-RT-AC750 v101b03, the sprintf function in the sub_40E700 function within the cgibin is susceptible to stack overflow.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is a **stack overflow** in a function called via the `cgibin` (likely a CGI binary or script).
- This suggests the vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a network request to the device's web interface.
- Stack overflow typically allows for code execution or crash, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- The function is in the `cgibin`, which is usually accessible via network (HTTP request).
- No mention of user interaction required.
- No mention of privileges required to exploit (likely none).
- Scope: If exploitation leads to code execution beyond the vulnerable component, scope might be changed.
- Impact: Stack overflow can lead to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since the vulnerability is in a CGI binary accessible over the network, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No special conditions or complexity mentioned. Stack overflow via `sprintf` is straightforward.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention of needing credentials or privileges.  
- Likely **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Stack overflow in a CGI binary could allow code execution beyond the vulnerable component, potentially affecting the entire system.  
- This suggests **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can disclose sensitive information.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can modify data or system behavior.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Stack overflow can crash the system or service, causing denial of service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Potential full disclosure of information        |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Potential full modification of data             |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Potential denial of service                      |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Formula for Scope Changed:**

- Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44^3)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 * 0.915  
= 6.88

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556  
= 8.22 * 0.472  
= 3.88

- Base Score = Roundup(Min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 * (6.88 + 3.88) = 1.08 * 10.76 = 11.62 → capped at 10.0

**Final Base Score: 10.0 (Critical)**

#####517#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- An XSS payload is uploaded as a DICOM study.  
- The vulnerability triggers when a user views the infected study inside the Osimis WebViewer.  
- Exploitation allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker uploads a malicious DICOM study, presumably over the network (e.g., via upload functionality).  
- The vulnerability triggers when a user views the study in the web application.  
- Since the attacker can upload remotely and the victim must view it, the initial attack vector is over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a valid DICOM study with an XSS payload.  
- Uploading a DICOM file is likely straightforward if the system accepts uploads without strong validation.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond uploading and victim viewing.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker uploads a malicious file.  
- The description does not specify that the attacker needs any privileges to upload the file.  
- Usually, upload functionality is available to authenticated users or sometimes even anonymous users.  
- Since the description does not specify, assume no privileges required to upload.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability triggers when a user views the infected study.  
- The attacker cannot trigger the vulnerability without the victim's action (viewing the study).  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.  
- This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the user's browser environment, not the underlying system or server.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the web application and browser).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a typical confidentiality impact of XSS.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary JavaScript can modify the content displayed to the user or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This impacts integrity to some extent.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability directly.  
- No indication that the vulnerability causes denial of service.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Summary of Metrics

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.83)  
= round_up(5.34)  
= 5.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####518#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerable plugin: Popup More Popups, Lightboxes, and more popup modules for WordPress, version 2.1.6.
- Vulnerability: Local File Inclusion (LFI) via the ycfChangeElementData() function.
- Attacker: Authenticated attackers with administrator-level access and above.
- Impact: Include and execute arbitrary files ending with "Form.php" on the server, allowing execution of arbitrary PHP code.
- Consequences: Bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution.
- Attack vector: Local File Inclusion, so the attacker must be authenticated and have admin privileges.
- The attack requires uploading or having files on the server (e.g., images or other “safe” file types) that can be included and executed.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion.
- The attacker must be authenticated and have admin access.
- The attack is performed on the server locally (not remotely over the network).
- However, WordPress plugins are typically accessed over the network, but the vulnerability requires admin privileges.
- The attacker must be authenticated and interact with the plugin via the web interface.
- According to CVSS v3.1, if the attack is performed remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP), AV:N.
- If the attacker must be on the same local network, AV:A.
- If the attacker must have local access to the machine, AV:L.
- If physical interaction is required, AV:P.

Here, the attacker is authenticated via the web interface (admin access), so the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with admin privileges.
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary file inclusion of files ending with "Form.php".
- The attacker must upload or have files on the server.
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing.
- The attack requires some conditions (authenticated admin, file upload or existing files).
- However, these are typical conditions for an admin user.
- No mention of race conditions or other complex conditions.

Therefore, the attack complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level access and above.
- Administrator-level access is considered **High (H)** privileges.

Therefore, PR = **High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker is authenticated and performs the attack.
- No mention of requiring another user to perform any action.
- The attacker acts directly.

Therefore, UI = **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- The impact is on the same security scope (the WordPress plugin and server).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.

Therefore, Scope = **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can bypass access controls and obtain sensitive data.
- This indicates a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code.
- This allows modification of data and code execution.
- Therefore, **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**

- The attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially disrupting service.
- This implies **High (H)** availability impact.

| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required beyond attacker actions.                                  |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact is within the same security scope.                                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Attacker can obtain sensitive data.                                                    |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Attacker can execute arbitrary code, modifying data.                                  |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Attacker can disrupt service via code execution.                                      |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [since Scope=U]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.85 = 6.987

6.987 * 0.77 = 5.380

5.380 * 0.27 = 1.452

1.452 * 0.85 = 1.234

Exploitability = 1.234

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)

= 6.42 * 0.915

= 5.874

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

= round_up(min(5.874 + 1.234, 10))

= round_up(7.108)

= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

#####519#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to arm64 topology.
- The issue is a possible integer overflow in a frequency setup function.
- The overflow could occur due to multiplication of frequency values.
- The description suggests a coding flaw, likely leading to incorrect behavior or potential security impact.
- No explicit mention of exploitation method, required privileges, or user interaction.
- The flaw is in kernel code, so local access is likely required.
- The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is not explicitly stated.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel code, specifically arm64 topology code.  
- Exploitation would require local access to the system to trigger the kernel function.  
- Not remotely exploitable over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is an integer overflow due to multiplication of frequency values.  
- Exploiting this likely requires specific conditions and knowledge of kernel internals.  
- Not trivial but not extremely complex either.  
- Given the need to trigger a specific kernel function with crafted input, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel vulnerability, triggering it likely requires at least some privileges to interact with the kernel topology or frequency settings.  
- Normal users may not have direct access to these kernel interfaces.  
- Likely requires Low privileges (e.g., a local user, not root).  
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is in kernel code and does not require user interaction to be exploited once the attacker has local access.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel, which is a security boundary.  
- If the vulnerability allows escalation or affects other components beyond the vulnerable code, scope changes.  
- The description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the kernel function.  
- However, kernel vulnerabilities typically affect the system scope.  
- Given the vulnerability is in kernel code and could affect system behavior, S = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention data leakage or confidentiality impact.  
- Likely None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Integer overflow could lead to incorrect frequency settings, potentially affecting system behavior or stability.  
- This could be considered a Low impact on integrity (e.g., incorrect data or state).  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- Incorrect frequency settings could cause system instability or crashes.  
- This could be a Low impact on availability.  
- A = Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger kernel function |
| AC     | L     | Exploitation requires specific conditions but not complex |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges needed to interact with kernel interfaces |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Kernel vulnerability affects system scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | L     | Possible incorrect system state due to overflow |
| A      | L     | Potential system instability or crash |

Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Summary:
- Vulnerability in OpenObserve's user management API endpoint.
- Any authenticated user within an organization can remove any other user, including Admins and Root users.
- No privilege checks are performed to restrict this action.
- This leads to unauthorized user removal, potentially causing administrative lockout and operational disruption.
- Exploitation requires the attacker to be an authenticated member of the organization.
- The attack is performed over the API endpoint (likely network accessible).
- The impact affects integrity (removal of users), availability (disruption of operations), and potentially confidentiality (unauthorized access due to user removal and lockout).
- No user interaction is required beyond being authenticated.
- Scope remains unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security authority).

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via the API endpoint "/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}".
- This implies a network attack vector (over the network).
- **AV:N**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to be an authenticated user in the organization.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- The vulnerability is due to missing privilege checks.
- **AC:L** (Low complexity)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated user in the organization.
- They do not need admin or elevated privileges.
- Being a normal user is sufficient.
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges means some privileges but not administrative.
- **PR:L**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker performs the action themselves.
- No other user interaction is required.
- **UI:N**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (user management within the organization).
- No privilege escalation beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.
- **S:U**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description focuses on unauthorized user removal and operational disruption.
- No direct mention of data disclosure.
- However, unauthorized user removal could indirectly lead to unauthorized access, but this is more an integrity and availability issue.
- So, confidentiality impact is **None**.
- **C:N**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can remove any user, including Admins and Root users.
- This is a direct and severe integrity impact on user management.
- **I:H**

**Availability (A):**  
- Removing critical users can cause operational disruption and administrative lockout.
- This is a high impact on availability.
- **A:H**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.1936  
= 0.8064

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.8064  
= 5.18

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(7.43)  
= 7.4 → 7.4 rounds to 7.4 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

**Severity Rating:** High (7.0 - 8.9)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in cms_admin.php via argument a_name.
- Impact: Critical.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Affected software: ForU CMS up to 2020-06-23.
- Unknown exact functionality affected, but SQL injection typically allows data disclosure and possibly data modification.
- No mention of authentication required.
- No mention of user interaction.
- No mention of scope change.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- SQL Injection via a web argument (a_name).  
- Usually, this means the attacker can send crafted requests over the network.  
- So, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection is generally straightforward if the input is not sanitized.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- So, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, SQL injection in a web app parameter is exploitable without authentication.  
- So, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends the malicious input directly; no user interaction is needed.  
- So, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since it is classified as critical and the exploit is public, assume High impact on confidentiality.  
- So, C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow data modification or deletion.  
- Assume High impact on integrity.  
- So, I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but not always.  
- The description does not mention availability impact.  
- To be conservative, assume None (N).  
- So, A = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * ISC**  
ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

Impact = 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 3.87, 10)) = round_up(9.05) = 9.1

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 4.37, 10))  
= round_up(10.25) → 10.0 (max score is 10)

#####524#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Gabriels FTP Server 1.2.
- The issue involves manipulation of the USERNAME argument.
- Leads to denial of service (DoS).
- Attack may be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- No detailed info on privilege requirements or user interaction.
- No mention of scope change.
- Impact is denial of service, which affects availability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack may be initiated remotely."  
- FTP is a network service, so the attack vector is Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- The attacker just manipulates the USERNAME argument.  
- Likely Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Likely None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required for the attack.  
- Likely None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- No mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Likely Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The impact is denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
- None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
- None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- Denial of service impact.  
- Severity not explicitly stated, but DoS usually at least Low (L).  
- Since it is described as "problematic" and leads to DoS, but no indication of complete shutdown, we assign Low (L).

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: N (None)  
- I: N (None)  
- A: L (Low)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or standard tables:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(5.3)  
= 5.3

According to CVSS v3.1 scoring, a score of 5.3 is Medium severity.

#####525#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Jinja templating engine.
- Allows injection of arbitrary HTML attributes via the `xmlattr` filter.
- This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- The attack involves bypassing auto escaping and possibly blacklist-based attribute validation.
- The vulnerability is related to injection in rendered HTML templates.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves injecting malicious content into templates that are rendered and then viewed in a browser.  
- The attacker likely needs to supply or control the template or input that gets rendered.  
- Since this is a templating engine, the attack can be triggered remotely by supplying crafted input that gets rendered.  
- Therefore, the attack can be performed over the network (e.g., via web requests).  
**AV = Network (N)**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description suggests that the injection is possible by abusing the `xmlattr` filter.  
- No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
- The attacker only needs to supply crafted input to the template.  
- This suggests low complexity.  
**AC = Low (L)**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to supply input that gets rendered by the template engine.  
- Usually, template injection vulnerabilities require no privileges if the attacker can control input that is rendered.  
- No mention of needing authentication or elevated privileges.  
**PR = None (N)**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability leads to XSS, which requires a victim user to view the rendered page.  
- The attacker injects malicious attributes, but the exploit requires the victim to load the page.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required (the victim must visit the page).  
**UI = Required (R)**

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the rendered HTML output, which is outside the security scope of the templating engine itself.  
- However, the impact is on the same security authority (the web application).  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities do not change scope because the impact is within the same security context.  
**S = Unchanged (U)**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- So, confidentiality impact is Low.  
**C = Low (L)**

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS allows an attacker to execute scripts in the victim's browser, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
**I = Low (L)**

---

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
**A = None (N)**

---

| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must load the page to trigger XSS.                                                |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact is within the same security scope.                                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial confidentiality loss due to XSS.                                                 |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Partial integrity loss due to script execution.                                          |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact.                                                                  |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.51 + 2.25)  
= Roundup (4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

- "The attack needs to be approached locally."  
- AV:L (Local)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- The attacker just manipulates arguments locally.  
- AC:L (Low)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates Host/Username/Password arguments.  
- Since it is a local attack and involves arguments like Host/Username/Password, it likely requires the attacker to have some level of access to the application or system.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say the attacker must be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Given the attack is local and involves manipulation of arguments, it is reasonable to assume **Low** privileges required (e.g., a user account).  
- PR:L (Low)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker performs the manipulation directly.  
- UI:N (None)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to Denial of Service.  
- No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Scope is likely Unchanged.  
- S:U (Unchanged)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The impact is Denial of Service, no mention of data disclosure.  
- C:N (None)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- I:N (None)

**Availability (A):**  
- Denial of Service impact.  
- The impact is availability loss.  
- The description does not specify the severity of DoS (partial or complete).  
- Usually, DoS is considered High impact on availability unless specified otherwise.  
- A:H (High)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:N = 0.00
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.41)  
= 5.4 (Medium severity)

- Location: /cupseasylive/countrymodify.php, in the countryid parameter.
- Impact: An attacker can send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user and steal their session cookie credentials.
- Exploitation requires the user to be authenticated (implied by "authenticated user").
- The attack is performed remotely by sending a URL.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack involves sending a crafted URL to an authenticated user.  
- No special conditions or timing constraints are mentioned.  
- XSS attacks generally have low complexity if the input is not sanitized.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the target system but the victim must be authenticated.  
- The attacker is remote and does not need privileges, but the victim must be logged in.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, PR is about the attacker’s privileges on the vulnerable component, not the victim.  
- Since the attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system, **PR: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim (authenticated user) to click or visit the specially crafted URL.  
- This means user interaction is required.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WP Event Manager WP User Profile Avatar allows Stored XSS. This issue affects WP User Profile Avatar: from n/a through 1.0.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in a web plugin. XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via a crafted HTTP request).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Stored XSS usually requires low complexity because the attacker just needs to submit malicious input that gets stored and later executed in victim browsers. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker typically does not need any privileges to inject stored XSS payloads in a web application input field.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attack requires a victim user to visit the page containing the malicious script for the payload to execute.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the web application). The vulnerability does not impact resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser, so it impacts confidentiality to some extent.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user, impacting integrity.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.4

Let's analyze the CVE description and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Missing Authentication for Critical Function + Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information.
- Affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX and EX Series.
- An unauthenticated, network-based attacker can access sensitive system information by guessing the name of a temporary file created during user login.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate.
- The attacker sends a specific request over the network.
- The impact is disclosure of configuration information (confidentiality).
- No indication of integrity or availability impact.
- No user interaction required.
- Scope is likely unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security authority).

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a request over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must guess the name of a temporary file. This guessing implies some complexity, but not high complexity like timing or environmental conditions.  
- Guessing a file name is somewhat complex but not very high. However, since it requires guessing, it is not "Low" complexity.  
- According to CVSS guidelines, guessing a file name is usually considered **High (H)** complexity because it requires some effort and is not straightforward.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated, no privileges required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information within the same security scope (the device itself).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can access sensitive system information (configuration).  
- This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
- The impact is significant but not total system compromise.  
- **Value:** Low (L) or High (H)?  
- Since the attacker can access configuration information, which is sensitive but not necessarily all data, this is typically considered **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the attacker can modify data.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.318  
= 8.22 × 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup(Min[1.41 + 2.22, 10])  
= Roundup(3.63)  
= 3.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
In Plotly plotly.js before 2.25.2, plot API calls have a risk of __proto__ being polluted in expandObjectPaths or nestedProperty.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability involves **__proto__ pollution** via plot API calls.
- This is a type of prototype pollution vulnerability, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or other impacts depending on how the polluted prototype is used.
- The attack vector is through API calls, which implies remote exploitation over the network.
- The vulnerability is in a JavaScript library (plotly.js), which is typically used in web applications.
- The attacker likely does not need privileges on the system, just the ability to send crafted API calls.
- User interaction is probably not required since the attacker can send malicious API calls directly.
- The scope might be changed if the vulnerability allows modification beyond the vulnerable component.
- The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability depends on the consequences of the pollution.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable via API calls, which are network accessible.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Prototype pollution usually requires crafting specific payloads but no special conditions or timing.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends API calls, likely without any authentication or privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can send malicious API calls directly; no user interaction needed.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Prototype pollution can affect the entire application or environment if the polluted prototype is used elsewhere.  
- This usually means the impact crosses security boundaries within the software.  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Prototype pollution can lead to data leaks or unauthorized data access.  
- The description does not specify data leaks, but pollution can lead to confidentiality impact.  
- Assign **Low (L)** as a conservative estimate.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Prototype pollution directly affects integrity by modifying object prototypes.  
- This can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of data.  
- Assign **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- Assign **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network via API calls |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses component boundaries |
| C      | L     | Possible data leak or info disclosure |
| I      | H     | Prototype pollution affects integrity significantly |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:L = 0.22
- I:H = 0.56
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 7.52 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.94

**Base Score =**  
If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
Else if Scope Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (4.94 + 3.91), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 8.85, 10))  
= round_up(9.55) = 9.6 → 9.6 rounds to 9.6 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

#####532#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
In OpenHarmony v4.0.0 and prior versions, a local attacker can cause a heap overflow through integer overflow.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is **local** (not remote/network). The description says "local attacker".  
  **AV:L**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack involves causing a heap overflow through integer overflow. Integer overflow vulnerabilities often require specific input conditions but are generally not considered highly complex if the attacker can control the input. Since the attacker is local and can trigger the overflow, the complexity is likely **Low**.  
  **AC:L**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "local attacker" but no mention of needing elevated privileges. Usually, local attackers have at least some privileges, but if the attacker is a normal user on the system, this is **Low** privileges. If the attacker needed no privileges, it would say "unauthenticated" or "no privileges". Since it says "local attacker" (not "local user" or "root"), we assume **Low** privileges required.  
  **PR:L**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required. The attacker is local and can cause the overflow directly. So, **None**.  
  **UI:N**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Heap overflow can lead to memory corruption within the same security scope (process or component). Unless the vulnerability allows control over another component or process, scope is **Unchanged**.  
  **S:U**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap overflow can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not mention confidentiality impact explicitly. Since it is a heap overflow, it could potentially lead to some information leak, but without explicit mention, we assume **Low** impact.  
  **C:L**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap overflow can allow modification of memory, so integrity is likely impacted. The description implies memory corruption, so **Low** or **High**? Since it is a heap overflow, it can be used to modify data or code. Without explicit mention of full control, assume **Low**.  
  **I:L**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap overflow can cause crashes or denial of service. So availability is impacted at least **Low**.  
  **A:L**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker |
| AC     | L     | Integer overflow, low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Local attacker with low privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within same scope |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [since Scope=Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.20) = 5.2 → 5.2 rounds to 5.2 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file in Fortinet FortiClientEMS versions 6.x through 7.x allows an attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specially crafted packets.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via "specially crafted packets," which implies the attacker can send data over a network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability involves improper neutralization of formula elements in CSV files, which is a common and straightforward attack vector (CSV injection).  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond sending crafted packets.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention the need for any privileges.  
- The attacker can send specially crafted packets, presumably without authentication.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability involves CSV files, which typically require the user to open or interact with the file to trigger code execution.  
- However, the description says "execute unauthorized code or commands via specially crafted packets," which suggests the attack might be triggered without user interaction (e.g., automatic processing of CSV files by the system).  
- But since it is a CSV file, usually the user must open or interact with the file for formula injection to execute.  
- Given the ambiguity, but leaning on typical CSV injection behavior, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of unauthorized code or commands.  
- If the exploited vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope, Scope is Changed (C).  
- Since the attack executes unauthorized code or commands, likely affecting the system beyond the vulnerable component, Scope = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Execution of unauthorized code or commands can lead to disclosure of information.  
- At least Low impact on confidentiality.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Execution of unauthorized code or commands implies the attacker can modify data or system state.  
- Therefore, I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Execution of unauthorized code or commands can disrupt availability (e.g., cause denial of service).  
- Therefore, A = High (H).

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Changed (C)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: High (H)

#####534#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM Security Access Manager Container (versions 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.6.1) allows a user to download files from an incorrect repository due to improper file validation.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability allows a user to download files from an incorrect repository.  
- The user must interact with the system to trigger the flaw.  
- Since the user is "a user" (not necessarily local), and the system is a container or appliance, the attack likely occurs over the network (e.g., via a web interface or API).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is due to improper file validation, which is a straightforward logic flaw.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "could allow a user to download files from an incorrect repository."  
- It does not specify if the user must be authenticated or have special privileges.  
- Since it says "a user," it implies some level of access is required, but not necessarily admin.  
- Likely, the user must be authenticated but with low privileges.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must initiate the download (trigger the flaw).  
- So user interaction is required.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to files from an incorrect repository, which may be outside the intended security scope.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Since the flaw is in the same component (container/appliance), and no privilege escalation or cross-component impact is described, Scope is likely Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The user can download files from an incorrect repository, which implies unauthorized disclosure of information.  
- The impact on confidentiality is at least Low (L).  
- It is unlikely to be High (H) unless the files are highly sensitive and fully disclosed.  
- Given the description, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability allows downloading files, but no mention of modifying files or data.  
- So no impact on integrity.  
- I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or impact on availability.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network |
| AC     | L     | Simple improper validation |
| PR     | L     | User must be authenticated (low privileges) |
| UI     | R     | User must initiate download |
| S      | U     | No scope change indicated |
| C      | L     | Unauthorized disclosure of files |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope=Unchanged)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62 ≈ 2.04

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 × 1 × 1) = 0.22

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore (since Scope=Unchanged)  
= 6.42 × 0.22 = 1.41

**Base Score:**  
= Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup(Min[1.41 + 2.04, 10]) = Roundup(3.45) = 3.5

#####535#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk® Service Platform (FTSP).
- Allows a malicious user to obtain the service token.
- The token can be used for authentication on another FTSP directory.
- Cause: Lack of digital signing between the FTSP service token and directory.
- Impact: Malicious user could retrieve user information and modify settings without authentication.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability involves obtaining a service token and using it on another directory.
- The description does not specify physical or local access.
- Since the token is used for authentication on another directory, it implies network communication.
- Therefore, **AV:N (Network)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is due to lack of digital signing, which is a design flaw.
- No mention of any special conditions or timing required.
- The attacker just needs to obtain the token and reuse it.
- This suggests **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is described as a "malicious user" who can obtain the service token.
- The description does not specify that the attacker needs any privileges to obtain the token.
- Since the attacker can authenticate without any authentication, it implies **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention of needing user interaction.
- The attacker can obtain and reuse the token independently.
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows authentication on another FTSP directory.
- This suggests the impact crosses security boundaries (from one directory to another).
- Therefore, **S:C (Changed)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can retrieve user information.
- This is a direct impact on confidentiality.
- The description suggests significant information disclosure.
- Therefore, **C:H (High)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can modify settings without authentication.
- This is a direct impact on integrity.
- Therefore, **I:H (High)**.

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of impact on availability.
- Therefore, **A:N (None)**.

| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact crosses security boundaries (different directory).                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Attacker can retrieve user information.                                                   |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Attacker can modify settings without authentication.                                      |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability mentioned.                                                      |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 1)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.1936]  
= 7.52 × 0.8064  
= 6.06

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= 1.08 × (6.06 + 3.89)  
= 1.08 × 9.95  
= 10.74 → capped at 10.0

#####536#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Use after free in WebGPU in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.199 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTML page, which implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network (e.g., by convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; "Use after free" vulnerabilities in browsers are typically straightforward to exploit once a user visits a malicious page.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the victim machine; just visiting a webpage is sufficient.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the user to visit a crafted HTML page, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the WebGPU component of Chrome, and exploitation leads to heap corruption, which can affect the browser process or potentially other processes. However, typically use-after-free in a browser renderer affects the same security scope (the browser process). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage. Given the severity is "High," some confidentiality impact is likely.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow an attacker to modify memory, potentially leading to code execution or data modification.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **Value:** Low (L) (since the description does not mention complete denial of service, but some availability impact is likely)

| Availability (A)     | L      | Possible partial denial of service (crashes)                                              |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.267]  
= 6.42 * 0.733 ≈ 4.71

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.71 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(7.53)  
= 7.5

- **Affected versions:** 1.3.8 to 1.3.12  
- **Attack vector:** The vulnerability is in a hook function, likely triggered by a web request. SQL Injection typically can be exploited remotely over the network.  
- **Privileges required:** Usually, SQL Injection in a web application can be exploited without authentication unless otherwise specified.  
- **User interaction:** Usually not required for SQL Injection.  
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the database, which is part of the same system, so scope is likely unchanged.  
- **Impact:** SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure (Confidentiality), data modification (Integrity), and possibly denial of service (Availability).

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  Because the vulnerability is exploitable remotely via web requests.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  SQL Injection usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  No indication that authentication is required.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  The attacker can exploit directly without user interaction.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same component (database) within the same security scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  SQL Injection can lead to full disclosure of database contents.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  SQL Injection can allow modification of database contents.

- **Availability (A):** Low (L)  
  SQL Injection can cause denial of service or partial disruption, but usually not complete system outage.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in wp.Insider, wpaffiliatemgr Affiliates Manager. This issue affects Affiliates Manager: from n/a through 2.9.31.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type

- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** is an attack that tricks a user into submitting a request that they did not intend to make.  
- Typically, CSRF requires the victim to be authenticated (i.e., have some privileges) and to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page).  
- The attacker usually does not need privileges themselves but relies on the victim's privileges.  
- The attack is performed over the network (via the victim's browser).  
- The impact is usually on integrity (unauthorized actions performed) and possibly availability or confidentiality depending on the action.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are performed remotely over the network via the victim's browser.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be tricked into clicking a link or visiting a page, but no special conditions beyond that.  
  This is considered **Low (L)** complexity.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be authenticated. The attacker acts through the victim's privileges.  
  According to CVSS v3.1, if the attacker does not need privileges, PR is **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
  **UI:R (Required)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF attacks typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application).  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF usually does not expose confidential information directly.  
  **C:N (None)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF allows unauthorized actions, so integrity is impacted. Usually, this is a **Low (L)** impact because the attacker can cause some unauthorized changes but not full control.  
  **I:L (Low)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF typically does not impact availability.  
  **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Network attack via victim's browser            |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Attacker needs no privileges                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact (click link, visit page)  |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Same security scope                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                        |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(4.23)  
= 4.3

#####539#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
In Appwrite CLI before 3.0.0, when using the login command, the credentials of the Appwrite user are stored in a file (`~/.appwrite/prefs.json`) with UNIX permissions 0644. This means any user on the local system can read those credentials.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability requires local access to the system because the file is stored locally and accessible to any local user.  
- Not exploitable remotely or over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack complexity is low because any local user can simply read the file; no special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a local user on the system, but no special privileges are required beyond being a normal user.  
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is due to file permissions and does not require any user interaction to exploit once the attacker has local access.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the confidentiality of the user's credentials stored in the file.  
- The impact is limited to the same security scope (the local user's data).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the local user’s scope.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can read sensitive credentials, which is a significant confidentiality impact.  
- C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability does not mention modification of the file or credentials, only reading.  
- I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No impact on availability is described.  
- A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, just reading a file |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges (normal local user) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same security scope |
| C      | H     | Credentials disclosure (high confidentiality impact) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

#####540#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### Summary of the vulnerability:

- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's `skb_segment()` function.
- It involves an MSS (Maximum Segment Size) overflow due to multiplication leading to an invalid segmentation size.
- This can cause a kernel crash (general protection fault).
- The crash is triggered by syzbot, a kernel fuzzer, indicating it can be triggered remotely or at least without physical access.
- The crash is a denial of service (DoS) via kernel crash.
- No indication of privilege escalation or code execution.
- The attack likely requires sending specially crafted network packets.
- The vulnerability is in the networking stack, so the attack vector is likely Network.
- No indication that user interaction is required.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability causes a crash in the kernel but does not affect other components beyond the kernel itself.
- The impact is on availability (kernel crash), no direct indication of confidentiality or integrity impact.

---

### Assigning CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The vulnerability is triggered by network packets (UDP, IPv6 GSO segmentation).  
   - **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - The vulnerability is triggered by a specific overflow condition involving MSS multiplication.  
   - However, the description says "many initial values of mss can lead to a bad final result," and syzbot can trigger it.  
   - This suggests the attack is not complex to perform once the conditions are known.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - The attacker sends network packets to trigger the crash.  
   - No indication that the attacker needs any privileges on the system.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - The attack is triggered by sending network packets, no user interaction required.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (denial of service).  
   - The impact is within the kernel itself, no indication that it affects other components or security authorities.  
   - **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - No indication of data disclosure.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - No indication of data modification or corruption beyond crash.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - The kernel crash causes denial of service.  
   - The impact is significant (kernel crash).  
   - **Value:** High (H)

---

### Final CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:

- AV:N (Network)
- AC:L (Low)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:N (None)
- S:U (Unchanged)
- C:N (None)
- I:N (None)
- A:H (High)

---

### Calculating the Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or standard tables:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:N = 0.00
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Exploitability + Impact, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.89 + 3.5952, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

#####542#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- An attacker uses a `javascript:` URI with a setTimeout race condition.
- This allows execution of unauthorized scripts on top origin sites in the URL bar.
- It bypasses security measures.
- Potential impact: arbitrary code execution or unauthorized actions within the user's loaded webpage.
- Affects Focus for iOS < 122.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves a `javascript:` URI in the URL bar, which implies the attacker needs to get the user to visit or interact with a crafted URL.  
- This is done remotely over the network (e.g., via a link).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires a race condition with `setTimeout` and a crafted `javascript:` URI.  
- Race conditions are generally considered to increase complexity.  
- However, the description does not mention any special conditions or environment requirements beyond the race condition.  
- Race conditions typically imply **High** complexity.  
- AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker executes unauthorized scripts in the context of the user's browser.  
- No mention of needing any privileges on the system or app.  
- The attacker only needs the user to visit or interact with a malicious URL.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must interact by visiting or clicking a malicious URL (javascript: URI).  
- So, user interaction is required.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of scripts on top origin sites in the URL bar, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or unauthorized actions within the user's loaded webpage.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the browser or app).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unauthorized script execution can lead to data disclosure within the user's loaded webpage.  
- This implies at least a Low impact on confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unauthorized actions and arbitrary code execution imply the attacker can modify data or state.  
- At least Low impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack via network (malicious URL) |
| AC     | H     | Race condition increases complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (click/visit URL) |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Unauthorized script execution leaks data |
| I      | L     | Unauthorized actions modify data |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.197  
≈ 1.62

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U),  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 1.62, 10))  
= round_up(4.13)  
= 4.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####543#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
libexpat through 2.5.0 allows recursive XML Entity Expansion if XML_DTD is undefined at compile time.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is in libexpat, a widely used XML parser library.
- It allows recursive XML Entity Expansion, which is a type of XML External Entity (XXE) or entity expansion attack.
- This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory).
- The condition is that XML_DTD is undefined at compile time, which means the parser allows entity expansion.
- The attack vector is likely remote because XML data is parsed, and an attacker can send crafted XML.
- The impact is mainly on availability (DoS).
- Confidentiality and Integrity impacts are likely none or low, as the description does not mention data disclosure or modification.
- User interaction is probably none, as the parser processes XML automatically.
- Privileges required: likely none, as the attacker just needs to send malicious XML to the parser.
- Scope: The vulnerability affects the same component (libexpat), so scope is unchanged.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  Because the attacker can send malicious XML over a network interface.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  The attack requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted XML.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  No privileges needed to exploit; attacker just sends malicious XML.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  No user interaction required; the parser processes XML automatically.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same component (libexpat).

- **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)  
  No indication of data disclosure.

- **Integrity (I):** None (N)  
  No indication of data modification.

- **Availability (A):** High (H)  
  Recursive entity expansion can cause DoS by resource exhaustion.

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

---

### Final summary:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: None (N)

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####544#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"In keyInstall, there is a possible escalation of privilege due to type confusion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires local access ("local escalation of privilege"). So, the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Usually, type confusion vulnerabilities are straightforward once local access is obtained.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "with System execution privileges needed." This means the attacker must already have high privileges (System level) to exploit this.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation, meaning the impact is within the same security scope (the system). No indication that the scope changes.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention confidentiality impact. Usually, privilege escalation affects integrity and availability more than confidentiality.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Escalation of privilege to System level means the attacker can modify system files, settings, etc.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | H     | System privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))

= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(3.59 + 0.79) = round_up(4.38) = 4.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: SQL Injection via manipulation of argument `data[sign]` in `/api.php` HTTP POST handler.
- Attack Vector: Remote (possible to launch the attack remotely).
- Attack Complexity: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection via HTTP POST with a known parameter suggests low complexity.
- Privileges Required: Not mentioned, likely none since it is a public HTTP endpoint.
- User Interaction: Not mentioned, likely none since the attacker can send the HTTP POST request directly.
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection typically affects the same component (database accessed by the web app), so scope is likely unchanged.
- Impact: Classified as critical, SQL injection typically impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some degree.
- Exploitability: Publicly disclosed and may be used.

---

### Assigning CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The attack can be launched remotely over the network (HTTP POST).  
   - **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - SQL injection via HTTP POST parameter manipulation is generally straightforward and does not require special conditions.  
   - **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - No mention of needing any privileges; the endpoint is accessible remotely.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - The attacker can send the HTTP POST request directly; no user interaction required.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability affects the same component (web application and its database). No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries.  
   - **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - SQL injection can lead to data leakage. Given the critical classification, assume high impact on confidentiality.  
   - **Value:** High (H)

7. **Integrity (I):**

### Summary of Metric Values:

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

---

### Calculating the CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of:  
- If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
- Else if Scope Unchanged:  
  BaseScore = min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 5.87 + 3.91 = 9.78 → 9.8 (rounded)

#####546#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An attacker can execute unauthorized scripts on a legitimate site through UXSS (Universal Cross-Site Scripting) using `window.open()` by opening a JavaScript URI, leading to unauthorized actions within the user's loaded webpage. This affects Focus for iOS < 122.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves executing scripts on a legitimate site by opening a JavaScript URI.  
- The attacker must cause the user to open a malicious link or URI, which implies the attack is remotely exploitable over the network (e.g., via a link).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a JavaScript URI and get the user to open it.  
- This is a typical UXSS attack, which usually requires some user interaction but no special conditions beyond that.  
- No special conditions or environment constraints are mentioned.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the victim's device or application.  
- The attack is performed by tricking the user into opening a malicious URI.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must open a JavaScript URI (e.g., clicking a link).  
- This requires user interaction.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows executing unauthorized scripts within the user's loaded webpage.  
- The impact is on the same security scope (the browser or app context).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unauthorized script execution can lead to unauthorized actions, which may include data theft or exposure.  
- This implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Since the description says "unauthorized actions," but does not specify full data disclosure, we assign Low (L).  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unauthorized script execution can modify data or state within the application.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value  | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N      | Attack can be performed remotely over the network via a malicious URI.                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L      | No special conditions required beyond user opening the URI.                               |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N    | No privileges required by the attacker.                                                   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R       | User must open the malicious JavaScript URI.                                              |
| Scope (S)            | U       | Impact is within the same security scope.                                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L       | Unauthorized script execution can lead to some data exposure.                             |
| Integrity (I)        | L       | Unauthorized script execution can modify data or state.                                  |
| Availability (A)     | N       | No availability impact mentioned.                                                        |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.51 + 2.68) = Roundup (5.19) = 5.2

#####547#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the uap.framework.rc.itf.IResourceManager interface of YonBIP v3_23.05 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted file.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves uploading a crafted file via an interface.  
- This suggests the attacker can exploit it remotely over a network (e.g., via a web interface or network service).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Uploading a crafted file is usually straightforward if the interface is exposed.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges before exploiting.  
- Arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities often require no privileges if the interface is publicly accessible.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker uploads a crafted file directly; no user interaction is needed.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable interface itself.  
- Arbitrary code execution usually means the attacker can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component, changing the scope.  
- Therefore, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary code execution typically allows full access to data, so confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or deny service, so availability impact is High (H).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

#####548#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Trend Micro Mobile Security (Enterprise) could allow an exploit against an authenticated victim that visits a malicious link provided by an attacker.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by the victim visiting a malicious link, which implies the attack is conducted over the network (e.g., via a web request).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to craft a malicious link, but no special conditions or timing are mentioned. Reflected XSS typically has low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "could allow an exploit against an authenticated victim," meaning the victim must be authenticated. The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be logged in. For CVSS, PR refers to the attacker’s privileges, not the victim’s. Since the attacker only needs to lure an authenticated user, the attacker requires no privileges on the system.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must visit a malicious link, so user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Reflected XSS typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Reflected XSS can lead to theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens), so confidentiality impact is Low.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Reflected XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that may modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, so integrity impact is Low.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Typically, reflected XSS does not impact availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

|----------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N      | Attack is over the network via malicious link                                             |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L      | No special conditions required                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N    | Attacker requires no privileges                                                           |

| Scope (S)            | U       | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L       | Possible disclosure of sensitive info                                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L       | Possible modification of data or actions                                                  |
| Availability (A)     | N       | No impact on availability                                                                 |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.68) = Roundup(5.19) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **5.2**, which corresponds to a **Medium** severity.

#####549#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the VAPIX API create_overlay.cgi.
- Insufficient input validation allows possible remote code execution.
- Exploitation requires authentication with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account.
- The flaw can be exploited remotely (via API).
- No mention of user interaction required.
- The vulnerability impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability (typical for remote code execution).

---

### Metric Analysis

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The vulnerability is in an API (create_overlay.cgi), which is typically accessible over the network.  
   **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; it only requires authentication. Input validation is insufficient, implying low complexity.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   Exploitation requires authentication with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account. This is a **High** privilege level.  
   **Value:** High (H)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   No mention of user interaction required for exploitation. The attacker can exploit after authentication.  
   **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**

---

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for confirmation)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27 when Scope is Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

Calculating Impact:

Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56)^3]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (0.44)^3]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 * 0.915  
= 6.88

Exploitability:

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.15 (approx)  
= 1.23 (approx)

Base Score (Scope Changed):

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (6.88 + 1.23)  
= Roundup (8.11)  
= 8.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####550#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges through a command injection vulnerability.
- Affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server.
- Fixed in specific versions.
- Reported via GitHub Bug Bounty.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker needs access to the Management Console user account.  
- The Management Console is typically accessed over a network (web interface or similar).  
- Since the attacker must already have a user account, but the attack is performed remotely via the console, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must have an editor role account, but no indication of additional complex conditions (like race conditions or timing).  
- Command injection is usually straightforward once access is obtained.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have an editor role user account.  
- Editor role is a non-administrative role but has some privileges.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges are those that provide some access but not administrative.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the user with the editor role; no indication that another user must interact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation within the Management Console.  
- The description says "could escalate privileges," implying the attacker gains higher privileges within the same security scope (the Management Console).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command injection can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.  
- Privilege escalation implies increased access to confidential data.  
- Likely **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Command injection allows modification of data or commands.  
- Privilege escalation implies the attacker can modify system or application data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No explicit mention of availability impact.  
- Command injection could potentially affect availability, but since not stated, assume **None (N)**.

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: Low (L)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: High (H)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) [since Scope is Unchanged]  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"A potential attacker with access to the Westermo Lynx device would be able to execute malicious code that could affect the correct functioning of the device."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must have "access to the Westermo Lynx device." This implies local access (physical or logical) rather than remote network access. Since it doesn't specify physical access, but just "access to the device," this is typically interpreted as Local (L).  
  **AV = L**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity. The attacker just needs access to the device. This suggests low complexity.  
  **AC = L**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "a potential attacker with access," but does not specify if the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges. Since it says "with access," it implies the attacker already has some level of access to the device, but it is unclear if this is user-level or higher. Usually, "access to the device" implies at least some user privileges, so likely Low (L) privileges required.  
  **PR = L**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the attack. The attacker can execute malicious code once they have access.  
  **UI = N**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the "correct functioning of the device," which suggests the impact is limited to the vulnerable component/device itself, not beyond its security scope.  
  **S = U**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
  **C = N**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can execute malicious code, which implies the ability to modify or control the system's behavior, so integrity is impacted.  
  The impact is likely High (H) because code execution can fully compromise integrity.  
  **I = H**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description says "could affect the correct functioning of the device," which implies availability impact (e.g., denial of service or disruption). This is likely High (H) because malicious code execution can disrupt availability significantly.  
  **A = H**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Attacker needs local access to device |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions or complexity |
| PR     | L     | Attacker needs some privileges (access) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable device |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | H     | Malicious code execution impacts integrity |
| A      | H     | Malicious code execution impacts availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(7.00)  
= 7.0 (High severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in Elite CRM v1.2.11 allows attacker to execute arbitrary code via the language parameter to the /ngs/login endpoint.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via the `/ngs/login` endpoint, which is typically accessible over the network (e.g., HTTP request).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities generally require low complexity to exploit if the input is not properly sanitized. No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker exploits the language parameter, which is usually accessible without authentication. No mention of needing privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attacker usually needs the victim to interact with a crafted link or page (e.g., victim clicks a malicious link).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code via XSS, but it is limited to the same security scope (the web application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, which impacts integrity at a low level.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in NitroPack.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affects: NitroPack plugin (versions up to 1.10.2)
- Impact: CSRF allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs an action without their consent.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network since the attacker lures the victim to a malicious website or sends a crafted request remotely.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page). However, no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed. This is considered low complexity.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need privileges on the target system, but the victim must be authenticated (have privileges). For CVSS, the metric considers the attacker's privileges, which are none.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
CSRF requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The attack does not impact resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
CSRF usually allows unauthorized actions but does not directly disclose confidential information. However, depending on the action, it might lead to some data exposure. Since the description does not mention data disclosure, assume low impact.  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
CSRF allows unauthorized modification of data or state (e.g., changing settings). This is a direct impact on integrity.  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
CSRF generally does not affect availability. No indication of DoS or service disruption.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U),  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####556#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
NVIDIA DGX A100 SBIOS contains a vulnerability where a user may cause a heap-based buffer overflow by local access. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable by "local access," meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs local access.  
- Heap-based buffer overflow is typically straightforward once local access is obtained.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "a user may cause..." which implies the attacker needs to be a user on the system.  
- This suggests some privileges are required, but not necessarily administrative or high privileges.  
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of needing another user to perform any action.  
- The attacker acts locally, so no user interaction is required.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects SBIOS, which is firmware-level.  
- Exploiting it leads to code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering.  
- Since the vulnerability affects the system beyond the vulnerable component (firmware to system), the scope is likely Changed (C).  
- S = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions "information disclosure."  
- This implies at least Low impact on confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description mentions "code execution" and "data tampering."  
- Data tampering implies at least Low impact on integrity.  
- Code execution could be High, but since it's local and requires privileges, and the description is general, we assign High.  
- I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description mentions "denial of service."  
- This implies at least Low impact on availability.  
- A = Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (user-level) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Scope changed (firmware to system) |
| C      | L     | Information disclosure (Low) |
| I      | H     | Code execution and data tampering (High) |
| A      | L     | Denial of service (Low) |

- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.268]  
= 7.52 * 0.732 ≈ 5.51

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (1.82 + 5.51) = Roundup (7.33) = 7.4

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.08

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[5.88 + 4.08, 10])  
= Roundup(9.96) = 10.0

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####559#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In keyInstall, there is a possible escalation of privilege due to type confusion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires local access ("local escalation of privilege"). So, the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV = L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Type confusion vulnerabilities are usually straightforward once local access is obtained.  
  **AC = L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed." This means the attacker must already have high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.  
  **PR = H (High)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
  **UI = N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation, meaning the impact is within the same security scope (the same system). No indication that the scope changes.  
  **S = U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention confidentiality impact. Usually, privilege escalation affects integrity and availability more than confidentiality.  
  **C = N (None)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Escalation of privilege to System level means the attacker can modify system files, settings, etc.  
  **I = H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A = N (None)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| AV     | L      | Local access required |
| AC     | L      | Low complexity |
| PR     | H      | System privileges required |
| UI     | N      | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U      | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N      | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | H      | High integrity impact |
| A      | N      | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(4.38) = 4.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

#####560#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in XunRuiCMS versions v4.6.2 and before, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via crafted malicious requests to the background login.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited by "remote attackers" via crafted requests. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; it just says "crafted malicious requests." Usually, XSS vulnerabilities are low complexity if no special conditions are mentioned.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "remote" and can send crafted requests to the background login. Since it targets the login page, the attacker likely does not need any privileges to attempt the attack.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities often require the victim to interact with a malicious link or page. However, this description says "allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via crafted malicious requests to the background login." This suggests the attacker sends the request directly to the server, not relying on a victim's interaction.  
  Therefore, **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows attackers to obtain sensitive information. Since it is an XSS vulnerability on the background login, it likely affects the same security scope (the vulnerable component). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can "obtain sensitive information," which indicates a confidentiality impact. Usually, this is considered Low or High depending on the sensitivity. Since the description does not specify full disclosure or total compromise, we assign **Low (L)**.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description does not mention modification of data or integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A = None (N)**

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L      | No special conditions mentioned                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N    | No privileges needed to send crafted requests                                             |
| User Interaction (UI)| N       | No user interaction required                                                               |
| Scope (S)            | U       | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L       | Sensitive information disclosure, but not full disclosure                                 |
| Integrity (I)        | N       | No integrity impact                                                                        |
| Availability (A)     | N       | No availability impact                                                                     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 1 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score = Impact + Exploitability**  
= 1.41 + 3.89  
= 5.3

Since Scope is Unchanged and Impact <= 0, the base score is rounded to one decimal place: **5.3**

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

#####561#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's gfs2 filesystem code.
- NULL pointer dereference in function gfs2_rgrp_dump().
- Triggered when creating rgd->rd_gl fails in read_rindex_entry().
- The issue is a NULL pointer dereference, which typically leads to a denial of service (kernel crash).
- The fix adds a NULL pointer check to prevent the crash.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's gfs2 filesystem code.
- To trigger this, an attacker likely needs to interact with the filesystem.
- Since gfs2 is a cluster filesystem, it can be accessed over the network or locally.
- However, NULL pointer dereference in kernel code related to filesystem usually requires local access (e.g., mounting or accessing the filesystem).
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Therefore, **AV: Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The NULL pointer dereference occurs when creating rgd->rd_gl fails.
- This suggests a specific condition must be met, but no indication that it is difficult or requires special conditions.
- The failure of creating rgd->rd_gl might be a rare or specific condition, but not necessarily complex.
- Given the description, the complexity is likely **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- Since this is a kernel NULL pointer dereference triggered by filesystem operations, the attacker likely needs to have some privileges to mount or interact with the filesystem.
- Mounting or accessing gfs2 filesystem usually requires at least local user privileges.
- No indication that root privileges are required.
- Therefore, **PR: Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker triggers the vulnerability by performing filesystem operations.
- No indication that another user must perform any action.
- The attacker themselves performs the action.
- Therefore, **UI: None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, which leads to a kernel crash or denial of service.
- Kernel crashes affect the entire system, not just the vulnerable component.
- This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects system-wide availability.
- Therefore, **Scope: Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- NULL pointer dereference leads to denial of service, no indication of data disclosure.
- Therefore, **Confidentiality: None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- No indication that data can be modified or corrupted.
- Therefore, **Integrity: None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**

- Kernel NULL pointer dereference causes system crash or denial of service.
- This impacts availability significantly.
- Therefore, **Availability: High (H)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Base Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger via filesystem operations |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions or complexity indicated |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges needed to interact with filesystem |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond attacker action |
| S      | C     | Kernel crash affects system scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service due to kernel crash |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:N = 0.0
- I:N = 0.0
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.68 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.246 ≈ 2.02

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

**Base Score Calculation (Scope Changed):**

BaseScore = RoundUp (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= RoundUp (Minimum [4.21 + 2.02, 10])  
= RoundUp (6.23)  
= 6.3

#####562#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: Portal Search module's Search Result app in Liferay Portal and DXP versions
- Attack vector: Remote authenticated users can inject arbitrary web script or HTML
- Condition: Highlighting is disabled, and the attacker adds searchable content (e.g., blog, message board message, web content article)
- Impact: Injection of arbitrary script or HTML, which typically affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some extent
- Authentication: Remote authenticated users (not anonymous)

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and interacts with the web application over the network.  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must add searchable content and the highlighting feature must be disabled.  
- This is a specific condition but not very complex; the attacker only needs to add content and the feature must be disabled (which is a configuration state).  
- This is a low complexity scenario because no special conditions beyond disabling highlighting and adding content are required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated user (remote authenticated users).  
- The description does not specify the level of privileges, but "remote authenticated users" implies at least low privileges (not high).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is stored XSS, which requires a victim user to view the injected content to trigger the script.  
- The attacker injects the script, but the script executes when another user views the content.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required (the victim must view the content).  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens) if exploited.  
- The impact is typically limited to low confidentiality impact because it depends on the victim's interaction and what data can be accessed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary script or HTML, which can modify displayed content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a low integrity impact because the attacker can modify data or perform actions but not fully control the system.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability directly.  
- No indication of denial of service or availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.33) = 5.3

#####564#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel firmware: arm_scmi component.
- The issue involves accessing reset domain descriptors by index via SCMI reset operations interface.
- If the SCMI driver misbehaves, this can lead to out-of-bound violations.
- The fix involved adding internal consistency checks before accessing domain descriptors.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is triggered by SCMI driver requests through the SCMI reset operations interface.
- SCMI (System Control and Management Interface) is typically accessed locally or via an adjacent interface, not over a network.
- Since SCMI is a firmware interface, often accessible only locally or via adjacent components (e.g., within the SoC or system bus).
- Therefore, **AV: Adjacent (A)** is most appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability requires the SCMI driver to "misbehave" (i.e., send malformed or out-of-bound index requests).
- This implies some conditions or specific behavior is needed.
- However, no mention of complex conditions or timing requirements.
- The attack is not trivial but also not highly complex.
- Given that the driver must misbehave, but no high complexity is indicated, **AC: Low (L)** is appropriate.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The SCMI interface is typically accessible by privileged components or drivers.
- However, the description does not specify that the attacker must have privileges.
- The vulnerability is triggered by SCMI driver requests, which implies the attacker must have the ability to send SCMI reset operations requests.
- This likely requires at least some privileges on the system (e.g., kernel or driver level).
- Since SCMI drivers are kernel components, the attacker likely needs **High (H)** privileges.
- Alternatively, if the attacker can be a user-space process that can send SCMI requests, it might be Low (L).
- Given the nature of SCMI and reset domain access, **PR: High (H)** is more accurate.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The vulnerability is triggered by SCMI driver requests.
- No mention of user interaction required.
- Therefore, **UI: None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability involves out-of-bound access to reset domain descriptors.
- This could lead to corruption or impact beyond the vulnerable component.
- However, the description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the kernel component.
- Since the vulnerability is within the kernel firmware component and affects kernel memory, the scope is likely **Changed (C)** because a vulnerability in one component (firmware driver) can affect the kernel or system integrity.
- Alternatively, if the impact is limited to the same security scope, it would be Unchanged.
- Given the potential for out-of-bound access leading to broader impact, **S: Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Out-of-bound access could lead to information disclosure.
- The description does not explicitly mention data leakage.
- However, out-of-bound access can potentially lead to reading sensitive data.
- Assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**

- Out-of-bound access can lead to memory corruption.
- This can affect integrity of data or code.
- Assign **High (H)** for integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**

- Out-of-bound access can cause crashes or denial of service.
- Assign **High (H)** for availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | SCMI interface is adjacent, not network accessible |
| AC     | L     | Requires misbehaving driver, but no complex conditions |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges to send SCMI reset requests |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses component boundaries (kernel memory) |
| C      | L     | Possible information disclosure via out-of-bound read |
| I      | H     | Possible memory corruption affecting integrity |
| A      | H     | Possible denial of service or crash |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Explaining PR value:**

- For Scope Changed, PR:H = 0.27

---

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.62 = 5.0964  
5.0964 × 0.77 = 3.9206  
3.9206 × 0.27 = 1.0586  
1.0586 × 0.85 = 0.8998

Exploitability ≈ 0.90

---

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.78 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.151]  
= 7.52 × 0.849  
= 6.39

---

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (6.39 + 0.90)  
= Roundup (7.29)  
= 7.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in LEPTON v7.0.0 allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading this code to the backend/languages/index.php languages area."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker uploads a file to a web application backend. This implies the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated but no other special conditions are mentioned. Uploading arbitrary files is usually straightforward once authenticated.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated, so some privileges are required, but it does not specify high privileges. Usually, "authenticated" implies Low privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is the one uploading the file; no other user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server, which likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., code execution impacts the entire system). This suggests the scope is Changed (C).  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is High (H).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data and system files. Integrity impact is High (H).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt service or delete files, causing availability impact. Availability impact is High (H).  
  **Value:** High (H)

|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |

| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | H     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact = 7.52 * (Impact Subscore - 0.029) - 3.25 * (Impact Subscore - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
  = 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
  = 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

- Since Scope is Changed:  
  Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 * (6.20 + 2.68), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 * 8.88, 10))  
  = round_up(min(9.59, 10))  
  = 9.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in Netfilter Connection Tracking (conntrack) in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a remote user to disclose sensitive information via the DCCP protocol."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the DCCP protocol, which is a network protocol.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No special conditions or environment requirements are mentioned. The attacker just needs to send crafted packets.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as a "remote user," implying no privileges are needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for exploitation.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's Netfilter conntrack subsystem. Exploiting it leads to information disclosure but does not indicate a change in scope (e.g., from kernel to user or vice versa). The impact is within the same security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The flaw allows disclosure of sensitive information. This is a direct impact on confidentiality.  
  The description does not specify the extent, but "disclose sensitive information" usually corresponds to **Low (L)** or **High (H)**. Since it is an out-of-bounds read, it likely leaks some data but not full system compromise.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of denial of service or impact on availability.

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(5.29) = 5.3

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **5.3**.

- No mention of required privileges or user interaction.
- No explicit mention of impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
- The vulnerability is in a web application (SourceCodester House Rental Management System 1.0).

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- XSS attacks are typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No special conditions or complexity mentioned.  
- The attack involves manipulating an argument (Name) to inject script.  
- This is usually straightforward.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated users.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS typically requires the victim user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page).  
- The attacker injects script, but the victim must load the page to trigger the script.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- The description does not specify the impact level, but generally, XSS leads to some confidentiality impact.  
- Assign Low (L) for confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to modify content seen by the user or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a low level of integrity impact (modification of displayed content).  
- Assign Low (L) for integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- Assign None (N).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)

= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact Subscore (S:U) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**

Since Impact ≤ 0, Base Score = 0 (not the case here)  
Otherwise, Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.52 + 2.68) = Roundup (5.20) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place: 5.2

#####568#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- The vulnerability is in omniauth-microsoft_graph before version 2.0.0.  
- The issue is that the `email` attribute is not validated for legitimacy.  
- This can lead to account takeover due to trusting an unvalidated email attribute.  
- The attack exploits a misconfiguration in OAuth (nOAuth) usage.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves the Microsoft Graph API and OAuth strategy.  
- OAuth is typically used over the network (web-based authentication).  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue arises from misconfiguration and lack of validation.  
- The attacker must exploit a misconfiguration (not a simple default).  
- Misconfiguration usually implies some complexity, but not very high.  
- However, since the attacker must trick the system into accepting a forged email, this is not trivial but also not very complex.  
- Given that the attacker must exploit a misconfiguration, **AC = High (H)** is appropriate.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this.  
- The attacker can send a crafted OAuth response with a forged email.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must authenticate via OAuth, but the vulnerability is in the backend validation of the email attribute.  
- The attacker does not require the user to perform any additional action beyond normal OAuth login.  
- The user interaction is part of normal login, so no additional user interaction is required.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to account takeover, which affects the same security authority (the user account in the same system).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Account takeover implies full access to the user's data.  
- This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Account takeover allows the attacker to modify user data.  
- This is a high impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- Account takeover does not necessarily affect availability.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network via OAuth API.                                      |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Requires misconfiguration exploitation, not trivial.                                     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed to exploit.                                                          |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No additional user interaction required beyond normal login.                              |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact is within the same security scope (user account).                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Account takeover leads to full data disclosure.                                          |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Account takeover allows data modification.                                               |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability mentioned.                                                     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:H (0.44)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.56

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = Round_up (Impact + Exploitability)**  
= 5.18 + 2.56 = 7.74 → Rounded up to 7.8

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

#####569#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1 contains a stack overflow via the adv.iptv.stballvlans parameter in the function formSetIptv.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered via a parameter (adv.iptv.stballvlans), which suggests it is exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via a web interface or network service).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Stack overflow vulnerabilities triggered by a parameter usually do not require special conditions beyond sending a crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention needing any privileges or authentication to exploit. Usually, parameters in web interfaces can be accessed without authentication or with minimal privileges.  
  Assuming no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the crafted parameter to trigger the overflow. No mention of needing a user to perform any action.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Stack overflow in a function likely affects the same security scope (the vulnerable component). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stack overflow can lead to code execution or crash. The description does not specify data leakage, but code execution can lead to confidentiality impact.  
  Since it's a stack overflow, it can potentially lead to high confidentiality impact (full system compromise).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Similarly, code execution or control over the system can lead to full integrity compromise.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Stack overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable remotely via network parameter                                |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                                                      |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                                              |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Potential full data disclosure via code execution                         |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Potential full system compromise                                          |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Potential denial of service or crash                                     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.83, 10))  
= round_up(9.71) = 9.7 → 10.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

#####570#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
TinyMCE versions before 5.10.0 are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A remote and unauthenticated attacker could introduce crafted image or link URLs that would result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in an editing user's browser.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted URLs. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to craft URLs to exploit the vulnerability; no special conditions or timing are required. This suggests low complexity.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The vulnerability requires the editing user to interact with the crafted content (e.g., open or edit content containing the malicious URL). This means user interaction is required.  
  **UI:R (Required)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability results in execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the editing user's browser, which is within the same security scope (the application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the user. This is typically considered a low impact on confidentiality.  
  **C:L (Low)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary JavaScript execution can modify data or content in the context of the user, so there is a low impact on integrity.  
  **I:L (Low)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
  **A:N (None)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attacker over network                                                               |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required                                                                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must interact with crafted content                                                   |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact is within the same security scope                                                   |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible disclosure of sensitive info                                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of data via JS execution                                            |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                 |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(5.35)  
= 5.4

#####571#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
IBM Engineering Lifecycle Optimization - Publishing 7.0.2 and 7.0.3 does not invalidate session after logout which could allow an authenticated user to impersonate another user on the system.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The issue is that the session is not invalidated after logout.
- This allows an **authenticated user** to impersonate another user.
- The attacker must be authenticated (i.e., have some privileges).
- The attack involves session management, likely via the network.
- No indication that user interaction is required.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority.
- The impact is impersonation, which affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some extent.

---

### Step 2: Assign values for each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves session management on a web application or service.  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to session not being invalidated after logout, which is a straightforward issue.  
- No special conditions or environment needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated user to exploit this (must have a session).  
- So, privileges are required but not high-level.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the session management flaw directly.  
- No indication that another user must perform any action.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows impersonation within the same system.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Impersonation can lead to unauthorized access to information.  
- This is a **Low** impact because the attacker can access data of another user but not necessarily all data or system-wide data.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Impersonation allows the attacker to act as another user, potentially modifying data.  
- This is a **Low** impact because the attacker can modify data as the impersonated user but not escalate beyond that.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Requires authenticated user (low privileges) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact due to impersonation |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact due to impersonation |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33)  
= 5.3 (Medium severity)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

#####572#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The POST SMTP Mailer WordPress plugin before 2.8.7 does not properly sanitise and escape several parameters before using them in SQL statements, leading to a SQL injection exploitable by high privilege users such as admin.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, which is typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests). Since it involves SQL injection through parameters, it is likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. SQL injection vulnerabilities are generally low complexity if parameters are not sanitized.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description explicitly states "exploitable by high privilege users such as admin." This means the attacker must already have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.  
  **PR = High (H)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required for exploitation. Usually, SQL injection vulnerabilities do not require user interaction beyond the attacker sending crafted requests.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the plugin, which likely affects the same security scope (the WordPress application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL injection can lead to data disclosure. Since the attacker is high privilege, the impact on confidentiality is likely high. However, the description does not specify the extent of data exposure. Given SQL injection, it is reasonable to assume at least a high impact on confidentiality.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL injection can allow modification of data. Given the attacker is high privilege and can inject SQL, integrity impact is likely high.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but the description does not mention availability impact. Given the nature of SQL injection, availability impact is often low or none unless specified.  
  We will assume **Low (L)** impact on availability to be conservative.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(6.68)  
= 6.7

- Manipulation of the argument "command" leads to OS command injection.
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Vendor did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- The vulnerable function is accessible via a CGI script (web interface).  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is an OS command injection via a CGI parameter.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- Usually, command injection via web parameters is straightforward if input is not sanitized.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates a CGI parameter remotely.  
- No mention that authentication or privileges are required.  
- Usually, such web interface vulnerabilities are exploitable without authentication unless stated otherwise.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the CGI script.  
- No mention that a user must interact or perform any action.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to OS command injection.  
- This means the attacker can execute commands on the underlying operating system, potentially affecting components beyond the vulnerable web application.  
- This usually means the scope is changed (the impact crosses security boundaries).  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- OS command injection can lead to full system compromise, including reading sensitive files.  
- This implies a high impact on confidentiality.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- OS command injection allows arbitrary command execution, which can modify or delete data.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- OS command injection can be used to disrupt services (e.g., delete files, kill processes).  
- **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via CGI |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | OS command injection affects system scope |
| C      | H     | Full confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Full integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Full availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 × 0.915  
= 6.88

- Base Score (Scope Changed):  
Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 3.89, 10])  
= Roundup (10.77, 10)  
= 10.0

#####574#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WhiteWP White Label – WordPress Custom Admin, Custom Login Page, and Custom Dashboard.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and impact

- **Vulnerability type:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)  
- **Affected component:** WordPress plugin features (admin, login page, dashboard customization)  
- **Effect:** CSRF allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs an unwanted action.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network (the attacker tricks the user via a crafted web request).  
- So, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious site or click a crafted link.  
- This is a common and straightforward attack, so complexity is Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be authenticated (have privileges).  
- For CVSS, PR is from the attacker's perspective. The attacker does not need privileges on the target system.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must interact by visiting a malicious site or clicking a link.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- CSRF typically affects the same security scope (the same application or domain).  
- No privilege escalation or crossing security boundaries.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- CSRF usually does not directly disclose information.  
- Confidentiality impact is None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- CSRF can cause unauthorized actions, modifying data or settings.  
- Integrity impact is Low (L) or High (H) depending on the action.  
- Since it affects admin/customization features, it could allow modification of settings or content.  
- Usually, CSRF is rated as Low (L) for integrity because it requires user interaction and privileges.  
- We'll assign Integrity = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- CSRF generally does not affect availability.  
- Availability = None (N).

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 * 0.78 * 1] = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(4.23) = 4.3

#####575#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability type: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- Affects: Howard Ehrenberg Custom Post Carousels with Owl plugin, versions up to 1.4.6  
- Impact: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation allows stored XSS  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Stored XSS typically can be exploited remotely by sending crafted input that is later rendered in a web page. The attacker does not need local access. The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Stored XSS usually requires low complexity because the attacker just needs to submit malicious input that is stored and later rendered without proper sanitization. No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
For stored XSS, the attacker usually does not need any privileges on the system; they just need to submit input (e.g., via a form or comment).  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
Stored XSS requires a victim user to view the malicious content for the exploit to have an effect (e.g., execute script in victim's browser). So user interaction is required.  
- UI: Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
Stored XSS affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). It does not affect other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Stored XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the victim user (e.g., cookies, session tokens, or other data visible in the browser). This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality.  
- C: Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
Stored XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, which impacts integrity at a Low level.  
- I: Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
Stored XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A: None (N)

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####576#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC V15.03.06.33_en contains a command injection vulnerability in the function formWriteFacMac. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via manipulation of the mac parameter.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable by manipulating a parameter (mac) in a function, likely via a network request (e.g., HTTP form submission).  
- Since the attacker can send data remotely, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Command injection via parameter manipulation usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges to exploit.  
- Usually, command injection in a web interface parameter implies no privileges required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends the malicious input directly; no user interaction is needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Command injection typically allows execution of arbitrary commands on the vulnerable component itself.  
- If the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., system-level impact), scope is changed.  
- Command injection usually leads to changed scope because it can affect the system beyond the application.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary command execution allows full modification of system files and data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary command execution can disrupt or disable services.  
- So, **High (H)**.

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####577#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Versions of the package libredwg before 0.12.5.6384 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to an out-of-bounds read involving section->num_pages in decode_r2007.c.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Denial of Service (DoS) caused by an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact:** Likely causes a crash or resource exhaustion, affecting availability.
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a library parsing data (likely from a file or network), the attack vector is probably Network or Local depending on how the library is used.
- **Privileges Required:** Depends on whether the attacker needs to be local or have privileges.
- **User Interaction:** Does the user need to do something for the attack to succeed?
- **Scope:** Does the vulnerability affect components beyond the vulnerable component?

---

### Step 2: Assign values for each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- libredwg is a library for reading DWG files. The vulnerability is in decode_r2007.c, which likely processes input files.  
- If the library is used in software that processes files from untrusted sources, the attack vector is likely **Network (N)** if the files can be received over a network, or **Local (L)** if the attacker must provide a file locally.  
- Since the description does not specify network service, and usually file parsing vulnerabilities require local file access, **Local (L)** is the most appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Out-of-bounds read due to malformed input is usually straightforward to exploit if the attacker can supply crafted input.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious file to the application using libredwg.  
- Usually, no privileges are required to supply a file to an application.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must open or process the malicious file for the vulnerability to be triggered.  
- This counts as user interaction.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a DoS in the application using the library.  
- It does not affect components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds read could potentially leak information, but the description only mentions DoS.  
- No explicit confidentiality impact mentioned.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data can be modified.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Denial of Service is an availability impact.  
- The impact is likely to crash or hang the application.  
- So, **High (H)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local file access to supply malicious input                      |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploitation with crafted input                          |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed to supply file                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must open/process malicious file                                    |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component                                   |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N     | No confidentiality impact reported                                       |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact reported                                             |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Denial of Service impact                                                 |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:N = 0.00
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6 × 0.56 = 3.36

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.36 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.19) = 5.2

#####578#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Cozmoslabs Profile Builder Pro. This issue affects Profile Builder Pro: from n/a through 3.10.0.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type

- The vulnerability is an **Exposure of Sensitive Information** to an unauthorized actor.
- This typically means an attacker can gain access to information they should not have.
- The impact is on **Confidentiality** primarily.
- There is no mention of impact on Integrity or Availability.
- The attacker is an unauthorized actor, so likely no privileges required.
- The vulnerability affects a web application (Profile Builder Pro), so likely exploitable over the network.
- No mention of user interaction required.
- No mention of scope change (i.e., the vulnerability affects the same security scope).

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Since this is a web application vulnerability and the attacker can exploit it remotely, the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity. Usually, information exposure vulnerabilities in web apps are low complexity. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "Exposure to an Unauthorized Actor," implying no privileges required. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit. Usually, information exposure vulnerabilities do not require user interaction. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Since this is an exposure of sensitive information, the confidentiality impact is at least **Low (L)**.  
  Without more details, assume **Low (L)** rather than High.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of integrity impact. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact. So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable over network                        |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Unauthorized actor, no privileges required      |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                     |
| Scope (S)            | U     | No scope change                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Exposure of sensitive information (low impact) |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact                              |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact                           |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.86

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[1.41 + 3.86, 10]) = Roundup(5.27) = 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in Atos Unify OpenScape Xpressions WebAssistant V7 before V7R1 FR5 HF42 P911. It allows authenticated remote code execution via file upload."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploited remotely ("remote code execution via file upload"). Since it is remote and over a network, the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. File upload vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if authentication is present. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "authenticated remote code execution," meaning the attacker must be authenticated. The level of privileges is not specified as high, so assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is authenticated and uploads a file. No mention of needing another user to interact. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  Remote code execution usually affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application). Unless the vulnerability allows control over resources beyond the vulnerable component, scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Remote code execution typically allows full control, so **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Remote code execution allows modification of data, so **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Remote code execution can disrupt service, so **High (H)**.

#####580#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Wow-Company Floating Button. This issue affects Floating Button: from n/a through 6.0.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type

- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** is an attack that tricks a user into submitting a request that they did not intend to make. It typically requires the victim to be authenticated and to interact with a malicious site.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network since the attacker tricks the user into sending a request via their browser.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious site or click a link, but no special conditions beyond that. This is generally considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need privileges on the target system, but the victim must be authenticated (have privileges). For CVSS, PR is from the attacker's perspective. The attacker does not have privileges on the target system.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious site or click a link).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF attacks typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions, but typically does not directly disclose confidential information. Usually, confidentiality impact is Low or None. Since the attacker can cause actions but not necessarily read data, we assign Low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF allows unauthorized commands to be executed, which can modify data or state. This is an integrity impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF typically does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.3

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####581#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in registration.php
- Affected software: Kashipara Hospital Management System up to 1.0
- Attack vector: Remote (attack may be launched remotely)
- Attack complexity: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection typically requires low complexity
- Privileges required: Not stated, but usually no privileges needed to exploit SQL injection in a registration form
- User interaction: Not stated, but typically none required for SQL injection
- Scope: Not stated, but SQL injection usually affects the same security scope (database and application)
- Impact: Critical vulnerability, likely high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to SQL injection

---

### Metric Determination:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack may be launched remotely" → Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL injection is generally straightforward if input is not sanitized → Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention of needing any privileges → None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required → None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL injection affects the database and application within the same security scope → Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL injection can lead to data disclosure → High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL injection can allow data modification → High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL injection can lead to denial of service or data deletion → High (H)

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)

#####582#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper input validation in some Intel NUC 8 Compute Element BIOS firmware may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack requires local access ("via local access").  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; improper input validation is usually straightforward. However, since it requires a privileged user and local access, it is not trivial but also not complex. Usually, local privilege escalation vulnerabilities are considered Low complexity unless stated otherwise.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege." This means the attacker must already have some privileges (not None). Since it says "privileged user" but not "highly privileged," this suggests Low privileges required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker is a privileged user with local access, so no additional user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in BIOS firmware, and the escalation is privilege escalation on the same system. The scope is likely unchanged because the impact is within the same security authority.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention confidentiality impact. Privilege escalation may allow access to more data, but since it's not explicitly stated, and the vulnerability is about privilege escalation, we can assume Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Privilege escalation typically allows modification of system settings or code, so integrity impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local access                                                                      |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions, straightforward exploit                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires a privileged user                                                                |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                                              |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact within the same security scope                                                     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible limited disclosure due to privilege escalation                                   |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Privilege escalation allows modification of system integrity                              |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability                                                                 |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [since Scope=Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568  
≈ 4.22

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(6.05)  
= 6.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####583#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in flaskcode package (up to version 0.0.8) for Python.  
- Unauthenticated directory traversal via a GET request to `/resource-data/<file_path>.txt`.  
- Allows attackers to read arbitrary files.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via a GET request, which is over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack is a straightforward directory traversal via a crafted URL.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated (no privileges required).  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a direct GET request; no user interaction is needed.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary files within the same software context.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary file read leads to disclosure of information.  
- This impacts confidentiality.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system compromise.  
- Assign Confidentiality = High (H) because arbitrary files can be read, potentially including sensitive data.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability allows reading files but not modifying them.  
- Integrity impact = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- Availability impact = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via GET request |
| AC     | L     | Simple directory traversal, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required (unauthenticated) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable component |
| C      | H     | Arbitrary file read leads to high confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score:**  
= Round_up (Impact + Exploitability)  
= Round_up (3.59 + 3.97) = Round_up (7.56) = 8.0

#####584#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via admin settings.
- Affected component: Chatbot for WordPress plugin version 2.3.9.
- Attack vector: Injection of arbitrary scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with administrator-level permissions and above.
- User interaction: The injected script executes when a user accesses the page (so user interaction is required).
- Scope: The vulnerability affects the plugin but the impact is on the web page content, potentially affecting other users.
- Impact: Injection of arbitrary scripts can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts depending on the script's payload.
- Conditions: Only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html is disabled.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with admin privileges and inject scripts via admin settings.
- The injection happens through the web interface (admin settings).
- The attacker is remote but must be authenticated.
- The attack is performed over the network (HTTP requests).
- So, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must have admin privileges and knowledge of the vulnerability.
- No special conditions or timing required beyond having admin access.
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization.
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must have administrator-level permissions.
- Administrator is considered High privileges.
- PR = High (H).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The injected script executes when a user accesses the injected page.
- So, the attack requires the victim user to view the page.
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows script injection that executes in the context of other users.
- The impact crosses privilege boundaries (from admin to other users).
- This means the scope is Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- So, confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying content or performing actions on behalf of users.
- Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- XSS can be used to perform actions that disrupt availability (e.g., script causing browser crashes).
- Typically, availability impact is Low or None.
- Given the description, no explicit availability impact is mentioned.
- We'll assign Low (L) to reflect potential minor availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network (HTTP) |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions beyond admin access |
| PR     | H     | Requires administrator privileges |
| UI     | R     | Victim must view the injected page |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses privilege boundaries |
| C      | H     | Potential disclosure of sensitive info |
| I      | H     | Arbitrary script injection affects integrity |
| A      | L     | Possible minor availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Changed]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.62 ≈ 0.90

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.78)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.151)  
= 7.52 × 0.849 ≈ 6.39

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.39 + 0.90, 10])  
= Roundup (7.29) = 7.3

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.44]  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

#####586#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to netlabel.
- Two out-of-bounds memory accesses (buffer overflows).
- These are coding errors leading to memory corruption.
- The description does not mention any required privileges or user interaction.
- The vulnerability is in kernel code, which typically requires local access.
- The impact is likely on confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to memory corruption.
- No indication that the scope changes beyond the vulnerable component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's netlabel subsystem.  
- Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities usually requires local access (an attacker must have some level of access to the system).  
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely or over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description says the errors are "embarrassingly simple" and fixes are straightforward.  
- This suggests low complexity to exploit.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel vulnerability, an attacker likely needs some privileges to trigger the bug.  
- Usually, local kernel vulnerabilities require at least low privileges (e.g., a local user).  
- No indication that root privileges are required.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Kernel vulnerabilities typically do not require user interaction.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel memory.  
- The description does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the kernel or changes privileges.  
- Usually, kernel vulnerabilities change scope because they can affect the entire system.  
- However, since the vulnerability is in the kernel and can lead to memory corruption, it likely changes scope (from kernel component to system).  
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds memory access can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data leaks, but memory corruption can lead to confidentiality impact.  
- Assign Low (L) for confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can allow modification of data or code.  
- Assign High (H) for integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Assign High (H) for availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.151]  
= 7.52 * 0.849 ≈ 6.39

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 * (6.39 + 2.52) = 1.08 * 8.91 = 9.62 → 9.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

#####587#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's media/xc4000 device driver in xc4000_get_frequency() function. This can result in return value overflow issue, possibly leading to malfunction or denial of service issue.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a device driver function in the Linux kernel.  
- Exploitation likely requires local access to the system because device drivers are typically accessed locally, not remotely over a network.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Race conditions usually require precise timing and conditions to exploit, which increases complexity.  
- So, AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel device driver, to interact with it and trigger the race condition, some level of privileges is usually required.  
- Typically, accessing device drivers requires at least low privileges (e.g., user-level access), but not necessarily root.  
- So, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any need for user interaction.  
- The attacker can trigger the issue by invoking the function or device driver interface.  
- So, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel device driver, which is part of the same security authority as the vulnerable component.  
- The impact is on the same system scope (kernel).  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions malfunction or denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
- So, Confidentiality impact = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption, only malfunction or DoS.  
- So, Integrity impact = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- Denial of service is explicitly mentioned.  
- So, Availability impact = Low (L) or High (H)?  
- Since it says "malfunction or denial of service," and no indication of complete system shutdown, Low (L) is appropriate.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:H (High)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:L (Low)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:H = 0.44  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.31

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.31, 10))  
= round_up(2.72) = 2.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

#####588#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
The vulnerability is in the Calculated Fields Form WordPress plugin before version 1.1.151. It does not sanitize and escape some form settings, allowing high privilege users (e.g., admin) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (such as in multisite setups).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves a user with high privileges (admin) exploiting the plugin's form settings.  
- The attack is performed through the web interface (plugin form settings).  
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface, which is local to the web application but accessible over the network (web interface).  
- Since the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the web interface, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires the attacker to have high privileges and knowledge of the plugin's form settings.  
- No special conditions or timing are mentioned; the attack seems straightforward once privileges are obtained.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description states "high privilege users such as admin" can exploit this.  
- So, the attacker must have **High (H)** privileges.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the high privilege user themselves performing the attack.  
- No other user interaction is required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows Stored XSS, which can affect other users or the system beyond the vulnerable component.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the plugin's scope.  
- Stored XSS typically affects other users (e.g., site visitors or admins), so the scope is likely **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- So, **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of other users, potentially modifying data.  
- So, **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)** availability impact.

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: High (H)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Changed (C)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

---

### Optional: Calculate Base Score (for completeness)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Changed) = 0.50  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.50 * 0.85 ≈ 2.28

**Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 7.52 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0, else:  
Since Scope is Changed:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (2.95 + 2.28), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 5.23, 10))  
= round_up(5.65) = 5.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

---

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 5.7 (Medium severity)**

---

**Final output:**

AV: Network (N)  
AC: Low (L)  
PR: High (H)  
UI: None (N)  
S: Changed (C)  
C: Low (L)  
I: Low (L)  
A: None (N)

#####589#####
Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Basix NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affects: Basix NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder – Contact forms and much more, versions up to 8.5.2
- Impact: CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs an unwanted action.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network since the attacker tricks the user into submitting a request via their browser.  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious site). However, the complexity is low because no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need privileges on the target system; the victim must be authenticated. The attacker exploits the victim's privileges.  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
CSRF requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
- UI: Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application). The impact does not cross security boundaries.  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
CSRF usually does not directly disclose information. However, depending on the action, it might lead to some information disclosure. Since the description does not specify confidentiality impact, assume none.  
- C: None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
CSRF can cause unauthorized actions, which affect integrity (e.g., changing data). So, integrity impact is Low or High depending on the action. Since the description is generic and does not specify full control or destructive changes, assume Low.  
- I: Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
CSRF generally does not affect availability.  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via victim's browser |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required (victim must act) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, same security domain |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact specified |
| I      | L     | Integrity impact due to unauthorized actions |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22 = 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 2.84) = Round_up (4.25) = 4.3

#####590#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Jenkins GitLab Branch Source Plugin 684.vea_fa_7c1e2fe3 and earlier allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a CSRF, which typically requires the victim to visit a malicious web page or interact with attacker-controlled content.  
- The attack is performed over the network (via the victim's browser).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page).  
- However, the complexity is usually low because the attacker only needs to trick the user into visiting a URL.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- CSRF attacks usually require the victim to be authenticated (have some privileges) in the target system.  
- The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must have some.  
- Since the attacker exploits the victim's privileges, PR is Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- CSRF requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious URL).  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows connecting to an attacker-specified URL, but it does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (Jenkins plugin).  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- The attacker can cause connections to attacker-specified URLs, but no direct data leak is described.  
- C = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can cause connections to attacker-specified URLs, but no direct modification of data or code is described.  
- I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via victim's browser |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trick user |
| PR     | L     | Victim must be authenticated (low privileges) |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required (visit malicious URL) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact described |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact described |
| A      | N     | No availability impact described |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6 × (1 - 1) = 0

Since Impact Subscore = 0, the Base Score is 0 (no impact).

---

### Step 4: Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score and Vector

- Because the impact subscore is 0, the overall Base Score is 0.0 (None).  
- This is typical for CSRF vulnerabilities that do not directly impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

#####591#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### Summary of the vulnerability:

- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's efivarfs filesystem.
- When the firmware does not support SetVariable at runtime, efivarfs is mounted read-only (RO).
- However, there is no permission check when remounting efivarfs as read-write (RW).
- This allows a user to remount the filesystem as RW and then perform operations that lead to a kernel crash (NULL pointer dereference).
- The crash is triggered by a local user running commands like `mount -o remount,rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars` and `efi-updatevar`.
- The crash results in a denial of service (kernel panic / Oops).
- No indication of data confidentiality, integrity, or availability impact beyond the crash (denial of service).
- The attack requires local access and user privileges to remount the filesystem.
- No user interaction is required beyond the attacker themselves performing the remount and updatevar commands.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (kernel).

---

### CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Values:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The attacker must have local access to the system to remount the filesystem and run commands.  
   - Not network or adjacent network.  
   - **Value: Local (L)**

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - The attack requires remounting the filesystem as RW despite it being mounted RO by default.  
   - This is a straightforward action once local access is obtained, no special conditions or race conditions mentioned.  
   - **Value: Low (L)**

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - The attacker must be able to remount the efivarfs filesystem and run `efi-updatevar`.  
   - Remounting system filesystems typically requires elevated privileges (root or equivalent).  
   - The description shows a user running `mount -o remount,rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars` which normally requires root privileges.  
   - **Value: High (H)**

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - The attacker themselves perform the remount and updatevar commands.  
   - No other user interaction is required.  
   - **Value: None (N)**

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (denial of service) but does not appear to affect other components beyond the kernel itself.  
   - The impact is within the same security scope (kernel).  
   - **Value: Unchanged (U)**

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - No indication of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
   - **Value: None (N)**

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - No indication that data integrity is affected.  
   - The crash is a denial of service, not data modification.  
   - **Value: None (N)**

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - The kernel crash leads to denial of service.  
   - This is an availability impact.  
   - The impact is likely High because kernel crash causes system reboot or halt.  
   - **Value: High (H)**

---

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to remount and run commands |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward remount and command |
| PR     | H     | Requires root privileges to remount filesystem |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond attacker actions |
| S      | U     | Impact confined to kernel, no scope change |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Kernel crash causes high availability impact |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.82

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - (0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
  = 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

- Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
  = 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

- Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1 of:  
  If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
  Else, Base Score =  
  If Scope is Unchanged:  
  min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Qyrr WordPress plugin before 0.7.
- The plugin does not escape the data-uri of the QR Code in the src attribute → leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- The AJAX action `data_uri_to_meta` is available to all authenticated users.
- CSRF check is present but nonce is available to users with role as low as Contributor.
- Any user with Contributor role or above can set a malicious data-uri in arbitrary QR Code posts.
- Result: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed via an AJAX action, which is a web request.
- The attacker must be authenticated (Contributor or above).
- The attacker can send a request over the network (HTTP request).
- Since the attacker can exploit remotely over the network, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Contributor role.
- The CSRF nonce is available to Contributors, so no complex conditions to bypass.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with at least Contributor role.
- Contributor is a low privilege role but not None.
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker is the one sending the malicious request.
- No other user interaction is required for the exploit.
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows stored XSS in QR Code posts.
- The impact is on the same security scope (WordPress plugin data).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive info.
- However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.
- Usually, XSS is considered to have Low confidentiality impact.
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- Stored XSS allows attacker to execute arbitrary scripts.
- This can lead to modification of displayed content or actions on behalf of users.
- Integrity impact is Low (L) because attacker can inject scripts but not directly modify data integrity in the system.
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- XSS generally does not affect availability.
- No mention of DoS or availability impact.
- A = None (N).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The EventON-RSVP WordPress plugin before 2.9.5 does not sanitise and escape some parameters before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Reflected XSS is typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via a crafted URL). The attacker sends a malicious link to the victim, who must visit it.  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Reflected XSS usually requires the victim to interact (click a link), but the attack itself is straightforward and does not require special conditions beyond user interaction.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability. The attack is against users with high privileges (e.g., admin), but the attacker themselves does not need privileges.  
**Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
The victim must click or visit a malicious link for the attack to succeed.  
**Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). The impact is on the same component.  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the user. This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
Reflected XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts in the context of the victim, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of the user. This is a partial loss of integrity.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
**Value:** None (N)

- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.68) = round_up(5.19) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **5.2**.

  CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visiting a malicious page). However, the attacker can induce the victim to perform the action without special conditions beyond user interaction. This is considered **Low (L)** complexity.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attacker exploits CSRF to execute arbitrary code, the victim must be authenticated with sufficient privileges to delete posts (likely an admin or editor). So, the attacker does not have privileges but relies on the victim's privileges. According to CVSS, if the attacker needs the victim to have privileges, the PR is based on the attacker's privileges. The attacker has **None (N)** privileges, but the victim must be privileged. For CSRF, the attacker has no privileges, so PR is **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  CSRF requires the victim to perform some action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a page). So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code within the same security scope (the CMS). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can execute arbitrary code, which likely leads to full data disclosure. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution implies full integrity compromise. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to denial of service or system compromise. So, **High (H)**.

| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must perform an action (e.g., visit malicious page)                                 |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Arbitrary code execution leads to full data disclosure                                    |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Arbitrary code execution leads to full integrity compromise                               |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(8.7) = 8.7 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Dell Display Manager application, version 2.1.1.17, contains a vulnerability that low privilege user can execute malicious code during installation and uninstallation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploited by a low privilege user during installation/uninstallation. This implies local access is required.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attack is straightforward for a low privilege user.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is a low privilege user (not no privileges, not high privileges).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack happens during installation/uninstallation, which typically requires user action. However, since the attacker is a low privilege user executing malicious code during these processes, it implies no additional user interaction is required beyond the attacker's own actions.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows code execution during installation/uninstallation, likely affecting the same security scope (the application or system). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of malicious code, which can lead to data disclosure. However, the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure. Usually, code execution implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
  Given the uncertainty, assign **Low (L)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows modification of data, so integrity is impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can lead to denial of service or disruption. The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but code execution often impacts availability.  
  Assign **Low (L)** as a conservative estimate.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required (low privilege user) |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward attack |
| PR     | L     | Low privilege user required |
| UI     | N     | No additional user interaction beyond attacker action |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Possible data disclosure implied by code execution |
| I      | H     | Code execution impacts integrity significantly |
| A      | L     | Possible availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5563  
= 8.22 × 0.4729  
≈ 3.88

2. Impact Sub-Score (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 × 0.915  
= 6.88

3. Base Score (Scope Changed):  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 3.88, 10])  
= Roundup (10.76, 10)  
= 10.0 (max score)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(7.10)  
= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####602#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- A buffer overflow in Shim (32-bit system).
- The overflow is caused by a user-controlled value parsed from a PE binary.
- This value is used for memory allocation, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- Results in memory corruption, crash, or data integrity issues during the boot phase.

---

### Step 1: Attack Vector (AV)
- The vulnerability involves parsing a PE binary, which is typically done locally or during boot.
- Since the flaw happens during the boot phase and involves a local binary, the attacker likely needs local access to the system or to provide a malicious binary.
- **AV: Local (L)**

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)
- The vulnerability is triggered by a user-controlled value in a PE binary.
- The attacker must craft a malicious PE binary, which is not trivial but also not highly complex.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- **AC: Low (L)**

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)
- The attacker must provide or influence the PE binary loaded by Shim.
- This implies some level of access to the system to place or modify the binary.
- Likely requires at least low privileges (e.g., user-level access) to place the malicious binary.
- **PR: Low (L)**

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)
- The vulnerability is triggered during the boot phase by Shim processing the PE binary.
- No indication that a user must perform any action after the malicious binary is in place.
- **UI: None (N)**

### Step 5: Scope (S)
- The vulnerability causes memory corruption and can lead to a crash or data integrity issues.
- Shim is part of the boot process, so corruption here can affect the entire system.
- The impact likely crosses privilege boundaries (from Shim to system).
- **Scope: Changed (C)**

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)
- The description does not mention information disclosure.
- The impact is memory corruption and crash, not data leakage.
- **Confidentiality: None (N)**

### Step 7: Integrity (I)
- The flaw can cause data integrity issues.
- Memory corruption can lead to modification of data.
- **Integrity: Low (L)** (since it causes data integrity issues but not full control or high impact)

### Step 8: Availability (A)
- The flaw can cause a crash.
- Crash leads to denial of service.
- **Availability: Low (L)**

### Summary of Metrics:
- AV:L (Local)
- AC:L (Low)
- PR:L (Low)
- UI:N (None)

- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:N = 0.0
- I:L = 0.22
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))

= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))

= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 0.78)

= 7.52 * (1 - 0.6084)

= 7.52 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))

= round_up(min(1.08 * (2.95 + 2.52), 10))

= round_up(min(1.08 * 5.47, 10))

= round_up(5.90) = 5.9

#####603#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"In video decoder, there is a possible out of bounds read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a video decoder, which typically processes local files or streams. The description does not mention remote exploitation or network access. Since it is a local denial of service, the attacker likely needs to have local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The issue is an out of bounds read due to improper input validation. Usually, such vulnerabilities are straightforward to exploit if the attacker can supply crafted input. No mention of special conditions or timing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "no additional execution privileges needed," implying the attacker does not need any privileges beyond what they already have. Since the attack is local, the attacker must have some local access, but no elevated privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The vulnerability is in a video decoder, which likely requires the user to open or play a crafted video file. This implies user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) locally. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes the security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability is an out of bounds read, but the description only mentions denial of service, not information disclosure. So confidentiality impact is none.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability leads to denial of service, which impacts availability. The description does not specify the severity, but typically a local DoS is considered Low impact unless it crashes the system or service completely. Since it is a denial of service, and no further details, we assume Low (L).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access needed to trigger |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward input validation issue |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must open/play crafted video |
| S      | U     | No scope change |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Denial of service causes low availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or tables:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.24)  
= 3.2

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [since Scope is Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 × 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(7.10)  
= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
FPE in paddle.topk in PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0. This flaw can cause a runtime crash and a denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** FPE (Floating Point Exception) in a function (paddle.topk).
- **Impact:** Runtime crash and denial of service.
- **Affected software:** PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0.
- **Attack vector:** Not explicitly stated, but since PaddlePaddle is a machine learning framework, it is likely that the attack can be triggered remotely by providing crafted input data or API calls.
- **Privileges:** Not explicitly stated, but usually such vulnerabilities can be triggered by users who can submit data or requests to the system.
- **User interaction:** Not mentioned, likely none.
- **Scope:** Not explicitly stated, but a crash/DoS usually affects the same component (unchanged scope).
- **Impact:** Denial of service (availability impact), no mention of confidentiality or integrity impact.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Since the flaw can be triggered remotely (likely via network input to the PaddlePaddle service), AV = Network (N).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity. Usually, a runtime crash via crafted input is low complexity. AC = Low (L).

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  No mention of needing privileges. Likely none, as the attacker just needs to provide input. PR = None (N).

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the attack to succeed. UI = None (N).

- **Scope (S):**  
  The crash affects the same component (runtime crash and DoS in PaddlePaddle). No indication that other components are affected. S = Unchanged (U).

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No mention of data disclosure. C = None (N).

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity loss. I = None (N).

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service is explicitly mentioned. This is a High impact on availability. A = High (H).

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

#####607#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's BPF DEVMAP_HASH implementation on 32-bit architectures.
- The issue is an integer overflow during the calculation of the number of hash buckets.
- This can lead to a crash (denial of service) on affected systems (e.g., arm32).
- The attack involves creating a DEVMAP_HASH with a very large max_entries value (> 0x80000000) and then updating it.
- The vulnerability is triggered remotely via BPF map creation and update operations.
- The impact is a crash (denial of service), no indication of code execution or data disclosure.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by creating and updating a BPF map, which can be done remotely via system calls or interfaces exposed to user space.  
- BPF maps are typically manipulated via system calls from local processes, not over the network.  
- So, the attack vector is **Local (L)**, since the attacker must have local access to the system to create and update BPF maps.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must provide a specially crafted max_entries value (> 0x80000000) to trigger the overflow.  
- This requires knowledge of the vulnerability and crafting a specific input, but no additional conditions or race conditions are mentioned.  
- This is not trivial but also not highly complex.  
- According to CVSS guidelines, this is likely **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Creating and updating BPF maps usually requires some privileges.  
- On Linux, creating BPF maps typically requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN or similar elevated privileges.  
- Therefore, **High (H)** privileges are required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the one creating and updating the map; no other user interaction is needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash in the kernel, which affects the kernel itself and potentially other processes.  
- However, the vulnerability is within the kernel and does not appear to affect other components beyond the kernel.  
- The scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No indication of data disclosure.  
- **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication of data modification or code execution.  
- **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash (denial of service).  
- This is an impact on availability.  
- The crash is likely temporary but can cause system instability.  
- This is **High (H)** impact on availability.

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to kernel, no scope change                                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No data disclosure                                                                         |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                                                                        |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Explaining PR:H (Scope Unchanged):**  
- For Scope Unchanged, PR:H = 0.27

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 × 0.77 = 3.481  
3.481 × 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 × 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 0.799, 10))  
= round_up(4.394)  
= 4.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####608#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- BuildKit has a race condition vulnerability when two malicious build steps run in parallel sharing the same cache mounts with subpaths.
- This can lead to files from the host system being accessible to the build container.
- The issue is fixed in v0.12.5.
- Workarounds involve avoiding untrusted sources or untrusted Dockerfiles with cache mounts.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack involves malicious build steps running in parallel inside BuildKit.
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious Dockerfile or build steps.
- The attack happens within the build environment, but the build environment is typically local or adjacent.
- However, since Docker builds can be triggered remotely (e.g., via CI/CD pipelines or remote build requests), and the vulnerability involves cache mounts that are local to the build environment, the attack vector is likely **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)**.
- Since the attacker must provide a malicious Dockerfile or build steps, which implies local or adjacent access, but not necessarily physical access.
- Given that the attacker must have the ability to run build steps (i.e., local or adjacent), **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack requires two malicious build steps running in parallel sharing the same cache mounts with subpaths.
- This is a race condition, which is generally considered **High (H)** complexity because timing and conditions must be just right.
- However, the description suggests it is reproducible by providing malicious build steps.
- Race conditions are often High complexity.
- So, **High (H)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be able to run build steps, i.e., submit build jobs or Dockerfiles.
- This implies some level of privileges to trigger builds.
- If the build system is exposed to untrusted users, then **None (N)**.
- If the attacker must be an authenticated user with some privileges, then **Low (L)**.
- The description mentions "untrusted Dockerfile" or "untrusted source," implying the attacker can submit build jobs.
- So, **None (N)** or **Low (L)**.
- Since the attacker can submit a malicious Dockerfile, likely **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack involves malicious build steps running in parallel.
- No mention of user interaction required for the attack to succeed.
- The attacker controls the build steps.
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows files from the host system to be accessible to the build container.
- This means the impact crosses from the host system (outside the container) to the container.
- The scope is **Changed (C)** because the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Files from the host system can be accessed by the build container.
- This is a confidentiality impact.
- The description does not specify if all files or sensitive files are accessible, but any unauthorized access to host files is at least **High (H)**.
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- The description does not mention modification of files, only access.
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of availability impact.
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Attacker must run malicious build steps locally or adjacent to the build environment.      |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Race condition requiring precise timing and conditions.                                   |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Attacker can submit malicious build steps without privileges.                             |

| Scope (S)            | C     | Impact crosses from host system to container (different security scope).                   |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Host files can be accessed by the container (high confidentiality impact).                 |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact mentioned.                                                            |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact mentioned.                                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (Local) = 0.55
- AC:H (High) = 0.44
- PR:N (None) with Scope Changed (C) = 0.85
- UI:N (None) = 0.85
- S:C (Changed)
- C:H (High) = 0.56
- I:N (None) = 0.0
- A:N (None) = 0.0

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.175  
≈ 1.44

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 × 0.56  
= 4.21

Since Scope is Changed (C), the formula for Impact is:

Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
Impact = 7.52 × 0.56 = 4.21

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (Minimum [4.21 + 1.44, 10])  
= Round_up (5.65)  
= 5.7

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted SWF file. SWF files are typically processed by software that parses them, and the attack can be launched remotely by providing a malicious file. This implies the attack can be performed over a network (e.g., by tricking a user to open a malicious file or by receiving it over the network).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit the vulnerability. Memory leak via crafted file parsing is usually straightforward.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs to provide a crafted SWF file to trigger the issue. No privileges are required on the vulnerable system.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the victim to process the crafted SWF file. This usually requires the user to open or load the file in the vulnerable application. So user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a denial of service (memory leak) in the same component (libming). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or causes a change in scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The issue is a memory leak causing denial of service, no indication of data disclosure.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No indication that data integrity is affected.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service caused by memory leak impacts availability. The impact is likely partial or full denial of service. Since the description says "allows attackers to cause a denial of service," we assume a high impact on availability.  
  **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack via crafted file over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must open/load crafted file |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service impact on availability |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(6.2752)  
= 6.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An attacker with access to the vulnerable software could introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting a cross-site scripting payload into the 'username' parameter in the SNMP configuration."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must have access to the vulnerable software to inject the payload.  
- Injection is done via the "username" parameter in SNMP configuration, which is typically local or adjacent network access.  
- Since SNMP configuration is often managed locally or via an adjacent network, and the description says "with access to the vulnerable software," it implies local or adjacent.  
- However, if the attacker must be on the same network segment or have local access, Adjacent (A) is appropriate.  
- If the attacker must be physically local or logged in, Local (L) is appropriate.  
- Since it says "with access to the vulnerable software," it suggests local access to the software, not just network access.  
- Therefore, **AV:L (Local)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker injects arbitrary JavaScript via a parameter.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- Injection seems straightforward.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have "access to the vulnerable software."  
- This implies some level of privileges, but not necessarily administrative.  
- Since the attacker can inject into the "username" parameter in SNMP configuration, which is a configuration setting, it likely requires at least low privileges.  
- Therefore, **PR:L (Low)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker injects the payload themselves; no mention of needing another user to do anything.  
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) injection in the software.  
- XSS typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable software).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user.  
- The description says "introduce arbitrary JavaScript," which can be used to steal cookies or data.  
- This implies at least Low confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, **C:L (Low)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript, which can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies at least Low integrity impact.  
- Therefore, **I:L (Low)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- Therefore, **A:N (None)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(4.34)  
= 4.3

#####611#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Totolink N200RE 9.3.5u.6139_B20201216
- Affects function `setParentalRules` in `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`
- Manipulation of argument `eTime` leads to stack-based buffer overflow
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Critical severity

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- The vulnerable function is accessible via `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` (a web interface).  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.  
- No special conditions or environment required are mentioned.  
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and presumably straightforward.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely via a web interface.  
- No mention of needing any privileges or authentication.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable CGI script.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in a web application component.  
- Typically, buffer overflows in the same component affect the same security scope.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., kernel or other components).  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or crash.  
- Potentially, attacker can read sensitive information or cause information disclosure.  
- Since it's a stack-based buffer overflow, it may allow reading or leaking data.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention information disclosure.  
- Given the critical rating and typical impact of buffer overflows, assume **High (H)** confidentiality impact (attacker can read sensitive data).  
- Alternatively, if unsure, Low (L) could be chosen, but critical rating suggests High.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of data.  
- This implies attacker can modify data or system state.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- **Value: High (H)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 4.37, 10))  
= round_up(10.25) → 10.0 (max score is 10)

#####612#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"There is a possible information disclosure due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure of health data with no additional execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description mentions "local information disclosure," implying the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV = L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity; the vulnerability is due to a missing permission check, which is straightforward.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  "No additional execution privileges needed" means the attacker does not need any privileges beyond what they already have. Since the attacker must be local, but no extra privileges are needed, this implies **PR = None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the exploit. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without involving another user.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to information disclosure but does not mention any impact beyond the vulnerable component. The scope is likely unchanged.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  There is information disclosure of health data, which is sensitive. This is a clear confidentiality impact. Since it is described as "information disclosure," but not total system compromise, this is likely **Low (L)** or **High (H)**. Given health data is sensitive, but the description says "local information disclosure," not full system compromise, **C = Low (L)** is appropriate.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact (information disclosure) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:N = 0.00
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.52, 10))  
= round_up(3.93) = 3.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N**

#####613#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Totolink T6 4.1.9cu.5241_B20210923.
- Affects /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi.
- Manipulation of the argument "topicurl" with input "showSyslog" leads to improper access controls.
- Attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Vendor did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- The vulnerable CGI script is accessible over the network (likely HTTP).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack involves manipulating a CGI argument to bypass access controls.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.  
- The attack seems straightforward once the input is known.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description implies no prior authentication or privileges are needed to manipulate the argument.  
- "Improper access controls" suggests the attacker can access something they shouldn't without privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker initiates the attack remotely by sending crafted input.  
- No mention of requiring a user to perform any action.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a CGI script, which likely runs with the same privileges as the web server.  
- The description does not mention privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component.  
- However, "improper access controls" could mean access to resources outside the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Since the vulnerability allows access to resources that should be restricted, it likely changes the scope.  
- Therefore, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows improper access controls, likely exposing sensitive information (e.g., system logs via "showSyslog").  
- This is a confidentiality impact.  
- The impact is probably more than none but not total system compromise.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention the ability to modify data.  
- The attack is about improper access, not modification.  
- Therefore, I = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning Summary |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Access to resources outside scope |
| C      | L     | Information disclosure (logs) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) — since Scope is Changed, PR:N multiplier is 0.85
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Since Scope is Changed (S:C), Impact Subscore formula is:

Impact = 7.52 × (Impact)  
= 7.52 × 0.22  
= 1.6544

**Base Score:**

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0, else:

Base Score = Round_up (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (Minimum [1.6544 + 3.89, 10])  
= Round_up (5.5444)  
= 5.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####614#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Integer overflow due to insufficient input validation.  
- Impact: An app may be able to cause a denial-of-service (DoS).  
- Platforms: tvOS, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS.  
- No mention of code execution, privilege escalation, or confidentiality/integrity impact.  
- The issue is fixed in specific OS versions.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by an app. Apps run locally on the device.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Integer overflow is typically straightforward to exploit if an app can supply input.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is an app, which implies some level of privilege.  
- On iOS and similar OSes, apps run in sandboxed environments with limited privileges.  
- Since the app is the attacker, and no elevated privileges are needed beyond running the app, this is **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention the need for user interaction.  
- The app itself triggers the issue.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a denial-of-service, likely affecting the app or system availability.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Usually, DoS caused by an app crashing itself or a system service without privilege escalation or affecting other components means **Unchanged (U)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of data disclosure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability may cause denial-of-service.  
- Denial-of-service impacts availability.  
- The description says "may be able to cause a denial-of-service," which usually corresponds to **Low (L)** impact (partial loss of availability).  
- If it were a complete shutdown or crash, it might be High, but "may be able" suggests Low.

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with these values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.24)  
= 3.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
XSS vulnerability in FireEye Central Management affecting version 9.1.1.956704, which could allow an attacker to modify special HTML elements in the application and cause a reflected XSS, leading to a session hijacking.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link to the victim, who then clicks it. The attack is executed over the network (e.g., via HTTP request).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond the victim clicking a malicious link. This is considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit reflected XSS.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Reflected XSS requires the victim to click a malicious link or interact with the crafted input.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the application itself). It does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Session hijacking implies the attacker can steal session tokens or sensitive information, which is a high confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can modify HTML elements, which means they can alter the content seen by the user, impacting integrity. This is typically considered a low impact because the attacker modifies data presented to the user but not stored data.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable over the network via crafted requests                                          |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Requires victim to click a malicious link                                                  |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Session hijacking leads to high confidentiality impact                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Attacker can modify HTML elements (low integrity impact)                                  |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability                                                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.3432 = 0.6568

**Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base**  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(7.04) = 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

**CVE Description:**  
"httparty before 0.21.0 is vulnerable to an assumed-immutable web parameter vulnerability. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can provide a crafted filename parameter during multipart/form-data uploads which could result in attacker controlled filenames being written."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and can send crafted parameters over the network (web parameter).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to provide a crafted filename parameter during upload. No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker can directly send the crafted request; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows attacker-controlled filenames to be written. This likely affects the same security scope (the vulnerable component itself) without impacting other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention any data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Attacker-controlled filenames being written means the attacker can control some data written to the system, which is an integrity impact. However, it is likely limited to the filename metadata, not full system integrity compromise. This is a **Low (L)** impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact (e.g., denial of service).  
  **Value:** None (N)

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attacker over the network                                                          |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                            |

- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(5.3)  
= 5.3

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U):

Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.51 + 2.25)  
= Roundup (4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 1 - [0.268]  
= 0.732

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Impact Score = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.732  
= 4.70

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (4.70 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (8.59)  
= 8.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the JS & CSS Script Optimizer.

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affects: JS & CSS Script Optimizer versions up to 0.3.3
- CSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs an unwanted action.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network since the attacker tricks the user into submitting a request via their browser.  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious site). However, no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need privileges on the target system; however, the victim must be authenticated (have privileges). For CVSS, the metric considers the attacker's privileges, which are none.  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
User interaction is required because the victim must be tricked into submitting the request (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious page).  
- UI: Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions but usually does not directly disclose confidential information. The impact on confidentiality is typically none or low. Since the description does not mention data disclosure, assume none.  
- C: None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
CSRF can allow unauthorized modification of data or state, so integrity impact is low or high depending on the action. Usually, it is low because the attacker can cause some changes but not full control.  
- I: Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
CSRF usually does not affect availability.  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(4.23) = 4.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (web application).  
- **Impact:** Usually low to high on confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the context.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network (web).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., visit the page) to trigger the XSS payload.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of some user information (e.g., cookies, tokens), but not full system compromise.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  XSS can allow modification of displayed content or actions on behalf of the user.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  XSS typically does not affect availability.

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"IBM Security Verify Access 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.6.1 could allow a privileged user to install a configuration file that could allow remote access."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability allows a **privileged user** to install a configuration file.
- This configuration file could allow **remote access**.
- The attacker must already have **privileged access** to the system.
- The vulnerability results in **remote access**, implying potential confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.
- The attack vector for the initial exploit is likely **local** or **adjacent**, since a privileged user must install the file.
- The scope is likely **unchanged** because the vulnerability affects the same security authority.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Since a privileged user must install the file, the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV:L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker must be privileged and install a configuration file. This is not trivial but also not complex once privileged access is obtained.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be a privileged user to install the configuration file.  
  **PR:H (High)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No indication that another user must interact for the attack to succeed. The privileged user is the attacker.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows remote access but does not indicate a change in security scope (e.g., from one component to another). The impact is within the same security authority.  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Remote access could allow reading sensitive data.  
  **C:H (High)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Remote access could allow modification of data.  
  **I:H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Remote access could allow disruption of service.  
  **A:H (High)**

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Requires local privileged user to install file |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity once privileged access is obtained |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | Remote access allows full confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Remote access allows full integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Remote access allows full availability impact |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(5.87 + 0.79)  
= round_up(6.66)  
= 6.7 → 7.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An integer overflow vulnerability in FreeImageIO.cpp::_MemoryReadProc in FreeImage 3.18.0 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial-of-service attacks and/or run arbitrary code."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a function related to memory reading in a library (FreeImage).  
- Typically, such vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if the library processes untrusted input (e.g., image files).  
- Since FreeImage is an image processing library, the attack likely occurs by providing a crafted image file, which can be delivered over a network.  
- Therefore, **Network (N)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Integer overflow vulnerabilities often require crafted input but no special conditions beyond that.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing constraints.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability, as it involves processing a crafted image file.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must get the victim to process a malicious image file, which implies user interaction (e.g., opening or loading the file).  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows obtaining sensitive information, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.  
- Arbitrary code execution usually implies the ability to affect components beyond the vulnerable component, potentially changing scope.  
- However, since this is a library vulnerability, and the impact is on the application using the library, the scope is likely **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can obtain sensitive information.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can run arbitrary code, which implies full control and ability to modify data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker can cause denial-of-service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of Name/Address argument.
- Affected software: code-projects Online FIR System 1.0, file registercomplaint.php.
- Attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- No mention of authentication or privileges required.
- No mention of user interaction.
- No mention of scope change.
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability is not explicitly stated but XSS typically impacts confidentiality and integrity to some extent, availability usually not affected.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to initiate the attack remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of any special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS usually has low complexity if input is not sanitized.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention of needing to be logged in or have privileges.  
- Usually, XSS in a public form means no privileges required.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS typically requires the victim to interact (e.g., click a link or visit a page).  
- The attacker injects script, but the victim must load the malicious content.  
- So user interaction is required.  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- XSS usually affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive info.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow attacker to execute scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or data.  
- Partial loss of integrity.  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- **A:N (None)**

- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

#####625#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Integer Overflow or Wraparound in openEuler kernel (filesystem modules).
- Impact: Forced Integer Overflow.
- Affected versions: openEuler kernel from 4.19.90 before 4.19.90-2401.3, and from 5.10.0-60.18.0 before 5.10.0-183.0.0.
- The vulnerability is in the kernel, specifically in filesystem modules.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel filesystem modules.  
- Typically, kernel vulnerabilities require local access because they involve kernel modules and filesystem operations.  
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, **AV:L (Local)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Integer overflow vulnerabilities in kernel modules often require specific conditions or crafted inputs but are generally straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel vulnerability, it likely requires some level of privileges to trigger.  
- Usually, local user privileges are needed to interact with kernel modules or filesystem operations.  
- It is unlikely that no privileges are required.  
- The question is whether low or high privileges are needed.  
- Since it is a local kernel vulnerability, usually low privileges (unprivileged user) can trigger it.  
- Therefore, **PR:L (Low)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Kernel vulnerabilities typically do not require user interaction beyond the attacker triggering the exploit themselves.  
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on kernel memory or kernel behavior.  
- If the vulnerability allows an attacker to affect resources beyond their own privileges or the kernel's security boundaries, scope is changed.  
- Integer overflow in kernel modules can lead to privilege escalation or system compromise, which changes scope.  
- Therefore, **S:C (Changed)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Integer overflow can lead to information disclosure if it allows reading of memory.  
- The description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact.  
- However, kernel integer overflows often lead to privilege escalation or denial of service rather than direct confidentiality loss.  
- Assume **C:L (Low)** if some information leak is possible, or **C:N (None)** if not.  
- Since the description does not mention info leak, assume **C:N (None)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Integer overflow can lead to modification of data or code, so integrity impact is likely.  
- At least low integrity impact (modification of kernel data or control flow).  
- Therefore, **I:L (Low)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Integer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Therefore, availability impact is likely low or high.  
- Since the description does not specify a crash or DoS, but integer overflow often leads to DoS, assume **A:L (Low)**.

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:L (Low)

- I:L = 0.22  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.68 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.246 ≈ 2.02

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 1 × 0.78 × 0.78)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 7.52 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score Calculation (Scope Changed):**

BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.95 + 2.02)  
= Roundup (4.97)  
= 5.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"SQL injection vulnerability in adv radius v.2.2.5 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is described as "local," meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV:L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL injection typically requires crafting a specific input but is generally considered low complexity if no special conditions are needed. However, since the attacker is local and must craft a script, this is likely low complexity.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "local attacker," but it does not specify if any privileges are required. Since it says "local attacker" and not "privileged user," we assume no privileges are required.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required for exploitation. The attacker executes a crafted script, so no user interaction is needed.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself, potentially changing the scope. However, since the description does not specify that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component, we assume scope is unchanged.  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including confidentiality impact. So, confidentiality is high.  
  **C:H (High)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is high.  
  **I:H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt availability, so availability impact is high.  
  **A:H (High)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.52, 10))  
= round_up(8.40) = 8.4

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **8.4**, which corresponds to a **High** severity.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection via manipulation of the argument "id"
- Affected software: Human Resource Integrated System 1.0
- Affected file: /admin_route/inc_service_credits.php (unknown part)
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- SQL Injection typically can be exploited over the network if the vulnerable parameter is accessible remotely.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the input is directly injectable without additional conditions.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web application parameter (`id`), and the attacker can manipulate it remotely.  
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- SQL Injection attacks typically do not require user interaction; the attacker sends crafted requests directly.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (the web application) and does not indicate that it affects other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data leakage.  
- Since it is classified as critical and the injection is possible, it likely leads to high confidentiality impact (e.g., full database disclosure).  
- Therefore, C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Given the critical classification, it likely allows high integrity impact (e.g., data modification or deletion).  
- Therefore, I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service or data deletion.  
- Given the critical classification, assume high availability impact.  
- Therefore, A = High (H)

### Step 2: Summarize Metric Values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

Base Score formula for Scope Unchanged:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085184  
= 0.914816

Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.914816  
= 5.874

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556325  
= 8.22 * 0.472876  
= 3.885

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.874 + 3.885, 10))  
= round_up(9.759)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 2.68, 10)) = round_up(6.27) = 6.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Missing Authorization vulnerability in Zorem Sales Report Email for WooCommerce. This issue affects Sales Report Email for WooCommerce: from n/a through 2.8."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Missing Authorization  
  This typically means that an attacker can perform actions or access data without proper permission checks.

- **Affected component:** Sales Report Email for WooCommerce plugin.

- **Impact:** Since it's a missing authorization, it likely allows unauthorized access or actions.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Since this is a WooCommerce plugin (web-based), and the vulnerability is about missing authorization, the attacker can likely exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Missing authorization is usually straightforward to exploit, no special conditions required.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Missing authorization means the attacker does not need any privileges to exploit.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Usually, missing authorization vulnerabilities do not require user interaction. The attacker can directly exploit.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same component (plugin) and does not affect other components or privileges outside the scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Missing authorization can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., sales reports). This is likely a **Low** impact because it may expose some data but not full system compromise.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Missing authorization might allow unauthorized modification of data or settings. However, the description only mentions missing authorization, not modification. To be conservative, assume **Low (L)** impact on integrity.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 3: Summary of metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.87, 10))  
= round_up(6.38) = 6.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in CodeAstro Expense Management System 1.0
- Affects the file templates/5-Add-Expenses.php, component Add Expenses Page
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the argument "item"
- The attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS usually requires low complexity if the input is not sanitized.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument (item) remotely, no mention of needing to be authenticated.  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited without privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS requires the victim user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page) for the script to execute.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user or session hijacking.  
- Usually, XSS leads to Low confidentiality impact (e.g., stealing cookies, session tokens).  
- Therefore, C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically considered a Low integrity impact.  
- Therefore, I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- Therefore, A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.35

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.35 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.17) = 5.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. This bug introduced a stack overflow hazard that could allow a local privilege escalation. This vulnerability was patched in version 4.5.3."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description states "local privilege escalation," which implies the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV = Local (L)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity. Stack overflow vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if the attacker can trigger the overflow straightforwardly.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since this is a local privilege escalation, the attacker must already have some level of privileges on the system (likely low or none). However, local privilege escalation usually means the attacker has low privileges and escalates to higher privileges.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. Usually, local privilege escalations do not require user interaction beyond the attacker executing code locally.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Privilege escalation typically means the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component (e.g., from user to kernel or system level). This implies a scope change.  
  **S = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention confidentiality impact explicitly. However, privilege escalation can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. Usually, local privilege escalation implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
  Let's assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Privilege escalation allows modification of system or data, so integrity is impacted.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact. Stack overflow could cause crashes, but the description focuses on privilege escalation, so availability impact is likely none.  
  **A = None (N)**

Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Apollo13Themes Apollo13 Framework Extensions.

**Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context**

- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- A CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs an action without their consent.
- Typically, CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated (i.e., the attacker does not have direct access).
- The attacker usually needs to lure the user to a malicious website or send a crafted link/email.
- The attack is performed over the network (via the victim's browser).
- The attacker does not need privileges on the target system but relies on the victim's privileges.
- User interaction is required (the victim must visit or interact with a malicious page).
- The scope is usually unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority.
- The impact depends on what the CSRF can do; often, it can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some extent, but usually, the main impact is on integrity (unauthorized actions performed).
- Confidentiality and availability impacts are often none or low unless the CSRF leads to data disclosure or denial of service.

**Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics**

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network via the victim's browser.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  CSRF attacks are generally low complexity because the attacker only needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious page.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker does not need privileges on the target system; the victim's privileges are used.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., visit a malicious page).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects resources within the same security scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)  
  CSRF typically does not expose confidential information directly.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  The attacker can cause unauthorized actions, affecting integrity at a low level.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  CSRF usually does not impact availability.

- AC:L
- PR:N
- UI:R
- S:U
- C:N

- A:N

**Step 4: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score**

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N → 0.85
- AC:L → 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) → 0.85
- UI:R → 0.62
- S:U
- C:N → 0.00
- I:L → 0.22
- A:N → 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**

= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - (1 * 0.78 * 1) = 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**

= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score =**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0

Else,

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(4.23) = 4.3

Rounded to one decimal place: 4.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
HCL DRYiCE MyXalytics is impacted by a path traversal vulnerability which allows file upload capability. Certain endpoints permit users to manipulate the path (including the file name) where these files are stored on the server.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves manipulating paths on certain endpoints, which implies interaction over a network (e.g., HTTP endpoints).  
- Therefore, the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description suggests that users can manipulate the path to upload files, which implies no special conditions or environment needed.  
- This is a straightforward path traversal and file upload.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "users" can manipulate the path, but it does not specify that the user must be authenticated or have special privileges.  
- Since it mentions "certain endpoints permit users," it likely requires at least some user privileges (e.g., authenticated user).  
- However, if the endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication, PR would be None.  
- Given the ambiguity, but the wording "users" (not "unauthenticated users"), we assume **Low (L)** privileges required.  
- **PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the user manipulating the path; no other user interaction is needed.  
- The attacker themselves perform the action.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows file upload and path manipulation on the server.  
- If the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (e.g., impacts other components or the system), scope is Changed (C).  
- Since the vulnerability allows file upload and path traversal, potentially affecting the server's file system beyond the application, scope is likely Changed.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention data disclosure or reading files.  
- The vulnerability is about file upload and path manipulation, which may not directly disclose information.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- File upload and path manipulation can allow an attacker to modify or add files on the server, impacting integrity.  
- This is a significant impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- However, uploading malicious files could potentially affect availability, but this is not explicitly stated.  
- To be conservative, assume no availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network endpoints |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | L     | Requires some user privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed beyond attacker |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security scope (server file system) |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | H     | File upload affects integrity |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)

### Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with these values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

#####636#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The hiWeb Migration Simple WordPress plugin through 2.0.0.1 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high-privilege users such as admins.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a reflected XSS in a WordPress plugin.  
- Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link to the victim, who must visit it. The attack is delivered over the network (HTTP request).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond the victim clicking a malicious link.  
- No complex conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.  
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL and sends it to a victim (e.g., admin).  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim (high-privilege user such as admin) must click or visit the malicious link.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the plugin's web page output.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the WordPress application).  
- No privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Reflected XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the victim.  
- This results in some loss of confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Reflected XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts in the context of the victim, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of the victim.  
- This implies some loss of integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.19) = 5.2

#####637#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"There is a command injection vulnerability of ZTE's ZXCLOUD iRAI. Due to the program failed to adequately validate the user's input, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escalate local privileges."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description mentions "command injection" and "escalate local privileges." Command injection typically requires local access to the system (e.g., via a local interface or shell). Since the attacker escalates *local* privileges, the initial access is likely local.  
  **AV = L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is due to failure to validate user input, which is usually straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained. No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
  **AC = L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker escalates *local* privileges, implying the attacker already has some level of access but not high privileges. The description does not specify if the attacker needs any privileges before exploitation, but since it is a local privilege escalation, the attacker must have some initial access (likely low privileges).  
  **PR = L (Low)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of needing another user to perform any action. The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly.  
  **UI = N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability escalates privileges locally, which means the impact is within the same security scope (e.g., same system). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S = U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
  **C = N (None)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Command injection can allow arbitrary command execution, which can modify or corrupt data, so integrity is impacted. Since it escalates privileges, the attacker can likely make significant changes.  
  **I = H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact (e.g., denial of service).  
  **A = N (None)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required for command injection |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges to exploit |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to command injection |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Exploitability + Impact, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.82 + 3.59, 10))  
= round_up(5.41) = 5.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"In jpg driver, there is a possible missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a "jpg driver" and requires "System execution privileges." This implies the attacker must have local access to the system to exploit it.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description mentions a "possible missing permission check," which suggests the attack does not require special conditions beyond having the required privileges. This implies low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which means the attacker must already have high-level privileges (System).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker with system privileges can exploit it directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to "local information disclosure." Since the impact is on the same security scope (local system), the scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The impact is "information disclosure," which affects confidentiality. The description says "local information disclosure," which is typically Low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of integrity impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | L     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| H   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | N     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.55 = 4.521  
4.521 * 0.77 = 3.481  
3.481 * 0.27 = 0.940  
0.940 * 0.85 = 0.799

**Impact = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22  
= 1.32

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 0.799, 10))  
= round_up(2.119)  
= 2.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:H = 0.44  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.318  
= 8.22 * 0.2703  
= approx 2.22

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1-C)*(1-I)*(1-A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1-0)*(1-0)*(1-0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1*1*0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= approx 1.41

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(1.41 + 2.22)  
= Roundup(3.63)  
= 3.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
FPE in paddle.lerp in PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0. This flaw can cause a runtime crash and a denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** FPE (Floating Point Exception) in a function (paddle.lerp).
- **Impact:** Runtime crash and denial of service.
- **Affected software:** PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0.
- **Attack vector:** Not explicitly stated, but since PaddlePaddle is a machine learning framework, the function is likely accessible via software interfaces or APIs, possibly remotely or locally depending on usage.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Is the vulnerability exploitable remotely over a network?  
- PaddlePaddle is a library/framework, often used locally or in cloud environments. The function paddle.lerp is a function call, so exploitation likely requires local code execution or local access to the environment running PaddlePaddle.  
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely over a network without local access.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Is the attack complex or straightforward?  
- The flaw causes a runtime crash due to a floating point exception. Usually, triggering such an exception is straightforward if the input can be controlled.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Does the attacker need privileges?  
- Since the function is called locally, the attacker likely needs to run code or input data to the function.  
- If the attacker can run code or input data without privileges, then PR = None (N).  
- If the attacker needs some privileges, then PR = Low (L) or High (H).  
- Given this is a function call, and the attacker must be able to run code or input data, but no mention of needing elevated privileges, assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does the attack require user interaction?  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker can trigger the crash by calling the function with crafted input.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- The crash causes denial of service, likely affecting the process or system running PaddlePaddle.  
- Does the impact cross privilege boundaries or security domains?  
- Likely the scope is **Unchanged (U)** because the crash affects the same component.  
- No indication that the scope changes.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Does the flaw cause data disclosure?  
- No mention of data leakage.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Does the flaw allow modification of data?  
- No mention of data modification.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Does the flaw cause denial of service?  
- Yes, it causes a runtime crash and denial of service.  
- Severity: Denial of service is usually Low or High depending on impact.  
- Since it causes a runtime crash, likely **High (H)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local function call required                    |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward to trigger                      |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed to call the function      |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                    |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the same component            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No data disclosure                              |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No data modification                            |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Causes denial of service via runtime crash     |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 2.52, 10))  
= round_up(6.11) = 6.1

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible limited data disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible data modification or code execution |
| A      | L     | Possible denial of service or crash |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6 * 0.526  
= 3.156

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.156 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.046)  
= 7.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####642#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue in 202 ecommerce Advanced Loyalty Program: Loyalty Points before v2.3.4 for PrestaShop allows unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily change an order status."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows **unauthenticated attackers** to change order status. Since PrestaShop is a web-based e-commerce platform, and the attacker is unauthenticated, the attack likely occurs over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. The attacker can arbitrarily change order status, implying low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is **unauthenticated**, so no privileges are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated and can perform the action directly. No user interaction is needed.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Changing an order status is likely within the same security scope (the application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability allows changing order status, but does not mention data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is none.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Changing order status is a modification of data, so there is an integrity impact. Since the attacker can arbitrarily change order status, this is a **high** integrity impact.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack possible by unauthenticated attacker |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required (unauthenticated) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Arbitrary change of order status impacts integrity highly |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

#####643#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection via manipulation of the argument "c" in check.php.
- Affected software: soxft TimeMail up to 1.1.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- SQL Injection typically can be exploited remotely over the network if the vulnerable parameter is accessible via a web interface.  
- Since the vulnerability is in a PHP file (check.php), it is likely accessible over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the parameter is directly injectable without additional conditions.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument in a web request, no mention of needing authentication or privileges.  
- Likely no privileges required.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request; no user interaction is needed.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection affects the same component (database accessed by the web app).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since it is classified as critical, likely high impact on confidentiality.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow data modification or deletion.  
- Likely high impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can cause denial of service or data loss.  
- Usually, availability impact can be high if the attacker can delete or corrupt data or crash the database.  
- Given critical classification, assume high impact.  
- **A = High (H)**

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score (for confirmation)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.9 (approximate intermediate step)

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]**  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * 0.915 = 5.87**

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 3.9, 10)) = round_up(9.77) = 9.8 (rounded to 9.8)

This aligns with a critical severity.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted request to a web service (Common.svc WSDL page). This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution via a crafted request typically do not require special conditions beyond sending a crafted request. No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and no mention of needing any privileges. The attacker can send a crafted request without authentication.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted request directly to the service. No user interaction is required.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., system-level code execution). This usually means the scope is changed.  
  **S = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is high.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows full modification of data and system state.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the system.  
  **A = High (H)**

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

The base score for these values is typically **9.8 (Critical)**.

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####645#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Severity: High
- Attack vector: Remote (Network)
- Privileges required: None (unauthenticated attacker)
- User interaction: Required (explicitly stated)
- Scope: Changed (the CVSS v3.0 vector given has S:C, and RCE typically changes scope)
- Impact on Confidentiality: High
- Impact on Integrity: High
- Impact on Availability: High
- Attack complexity: High (from the given CVSS v3.0 vector AC:H)

The CVSS v3.0 vector given is:  
`CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`  
with a score of 8.3.

We are asked to calculate CVSS v3.1 base score and vector string based on the description.

---

### Step 1: Assign metric values based on the description

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)  
  The given vector and description say AC:H.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker is unauthenticated.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The description says "requires user interaction."

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)  
  The CVSS v3.0 vector has S:C, and RCE usually changes scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  High impact on confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  High impact on integrity.

- **Availability (A):** High (H)  
  High impact on availability.

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85) because scope is changed
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.197  
≈ 1.62

**Impact Sub-Score (ISC) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Since Scope is Changed:  
**Impact = 7.52 * (ISC - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC - 0.02)^15**  
= 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
= 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
= 6.66 - 0.46  
= 6.20

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An indirect Object Reference (IDOR) in the Order and Invoice pages in Floorsight Customer Portal Q3 2023 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to view sensitive customer information."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is "remote" and "unauthenticated," accessing the Order and Invoice pages via the customer portal, which is presumably accessible over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  IDOR vulnerabilities typically require no special conditions beyond knowing or guessing the object reference. Since the attacker is unauthenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely, the complexity is low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "unauthenticated," meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is remote and unauthenticated, exploiting the vulnerability directly. No user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows viewing sensitive customer information, but it is within the same security scope (the customer portal). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security authority.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can view sensitive customer information, which is a confidentiality impact. Since the description says "sensitive customer information," this is likely a **High** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  There is no mention of modification of data, only viewing.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  There is no mention of disruption or denial of service.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | N     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5563  
= 8.22 × 0.4729  
≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore (since Scope is Unchanged)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of the minimum of (Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= Impact + Exploitability  
= 3.5952 + 3.88  
= 7.4752 → 7.5

#####647#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1 contains a stack overflow via the serverName parameter in the function fromAdvSetMacMtuWan.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type:** Stack overflow (memory corruption)  
- **Parameter:** serverName (likely input from network or local source)  
- **Function:** fromAdvSetMacMtuWan (sounds like a function related to WAN settings)  
- **Device:** Tenda AX1803 router firmware v1.0.0.1

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since this is a router and the vulnerability is in a function related to WAN settings, the input likely comes from the network (e.g., remote attacker sending crafted packets or requests).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stack overflow vulnerabilities typically require crafted input but no special conditions beyond that.  
- No mention of needing special conditions or timing.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing authentication or privileges.  
- Usually, WAN-facing parameters can be accessed without authentication.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Exploitation likely automatic upon receiving crafted input.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Stack overflow in a function related to WAN settings likely affects the same security scope (the router firmware).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stack overflow can lead to code execution or information disclosure.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention info disclosure.  
- Given the nature of stack overflow, it can lead to high confidentiality impact (e.g., arbitrary code execution).  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stack overflow can allow arbitrary code execution, which can modify system files or settings.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Stack overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- **Value:** High (H)

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.36

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 4.36, 10))  
= round_up(10.24) = 10.0

#####648#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Uncontrolled search path in some Intel NUC Pro Software Suite Configuration Tool software installers before version 3.0.0.6 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires "local access" — the attacker must be on the local system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs local access and to be authenticated. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "may allow an authenticated user" — so the attacker must be authenticated, but no indication that high privileges are required. Usually "authenticated user" implies at least low privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required by another user. The attacker is authenticated and local, so no additional user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes denial of service "via local access" but no indication that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components beyond the vulnerable component. So scope is likely unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The impact is denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service impact means availability is affected. The description says "potentially enable denial of service," so at least low impact on availability. Since it is a denial of service, and no indication of complete shutdown, we assign Low (L).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Authenticated user required (low privileges) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Denial of service impact on availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(1.41 + 1.83)  
= round_up(3.24)  
= 3.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####649#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"IBM Security Verify Access 10.0.6 could disclose sensitive snapshot information due to missing encryption."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability leads to **disclosure of sensitive information** (confidentiality impact).
- The cause is **missing encryption**, which suggests data is exposed.
- No mention of modification or destruction of data, so integrity and availability impacts are likely none.
- The vulnerability is in IBM Security Verify Access, which is typically a network-facing product.
- No mention of needing user interaction.
- No mention of needing privileges.
- No mention of scope change.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since this is a network-facing product and the issue is data disclosure, likely exploitable remotely over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Missing encryption is a straightforward issue, no special conditions mentioned.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges to exploit.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (disclosure of data within the same security scope).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Disclosure of sensitive snapshot information indicates a **High** confidentiality impact.  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification.  
- **I:N (None)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 1 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(0.56 * 6.42 + 3.89, 10))  
Note: The formula for Impact when Scope is Unchanged is:  
Impact = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

Total = 3.5952 + 3.89 = 7.4852

Rounded up to one decimal place: 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in AVA teaching video application service platform version 3.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to ajax.aspx.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable by remote attackers via a crafted script sent to a web endpoint (ajax.aspx). This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require minimal conditions to exploit, especially if no special conditions or user environment constraints are mentioned. The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote attackers" with no mention of needing any privileges or authentication. This suggests no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS usually requires the victim to interact with the malicious script, e.g., by visiting a crafted URL or page. The description does not explicitly say "no user interaction," so we assume user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code via XSS, but it is within the same security scope (the web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality unless explicitly stated otherwise.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, which impacts integrity at a Low level.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability. No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)

- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
  = 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
  = 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
  Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
  = round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
  = round_up(5.19) = 5.2

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

#####651#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Open edX Platform allows a user with a JWT and limited scopes to call endpoints exceeding their access.  
- This implies an authorization bypass or privilege escalation within the application.  
- The attacker needs to have a JWT (authentication token) but with limited scopes.  
- The attacker can call endpoints beyond their allowed access.  
- The vulnerability is patched.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker uses a JWT token to call endpoints.  
- This implies the attack is performed over the network (e.g., HTTP API calls).  
- So, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs a JWT with limited scopes, which implies the attacker must already have some access or credentials.  
- However, no special conditions or environment are mentioned that make the attack complex.  
- The attacker just abuses the token scopes.  
- So, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have a JWT with limited scopes, so some privileges are required (authentication).  
- The attacker is not unauthenticated (PR:N), but has limited privileges.  
- So, PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker uses their own JWT to call endpoints.  
- No indication that another user must perform any action.  
- So, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows calling endpoints exceeding their access, but it is within the same component (Open edX Platform).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can access endpoints beyond their allowed scope, which may expose additional data.  
- Since the attacker can access more data than intended, confidentiality is impacted.  
- The impact is likely partial, not full system compromise.  
- So, Confidentiality = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can call endpoints beyond their access, which may allow modification of data.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data modification, but "exceeding their access" could include write operations.  
- To be conservative, assume Low (L) impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, Availability = None (N)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope=Unchanged)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1:**  
= Impact + Exploitability = 2.51 + 2.68 = 5.19 → 5.2 (Medium severity)

#####652#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The Community by PeepSo WordPress plugin before 6.3.1.2 does not have CSRF check when creating a user post (visible on their wall in their profile page), which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform such action via a CSRF attack.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user to perform an action via CSRF.  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely by sending a crafted link or page.  
- The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
**Value:** Network (N)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires the victim to be tricked into performing an action (CSRF).  
- This is a common and straightforward attack with no special conditions.  
- Therefore, the complexity is low.  
**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges themselves but requires the victim to be logged in.  
- The attacker exploits the victim's privileges.  
- According to CVSS, if the attacker needs the victim to have privileges, but the attacker themselves does not, PR is None (N).  
- However, since the attacker needs the victim to be logged in (i.e., the victim has privileges), the attacker does not need privileges.  
**Value:** None (N)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim to perform an action (e.g., click a link or visit a page).  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
**Value:** Required (R)

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to make the victim perform an action within the same security scope (the WordPress plugin).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, scope is unchanged.  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows creating a post on the victim's profile wall.  
- There is no indication of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
**Value:** None (N)

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can cause the victim to create a post, which modifies data (content on the profile wall).  
- This is a modification of data, so there is an integrity impact.  
- The impact is likely low because the attacker can only add posts, not fully control or delete content.  
**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Availability (A):**  
- There is no indication that availability is affected.  
**Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via web |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity CSRF attack |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required (victim clicks) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (post creation) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

#####653#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in LearnPress WordPress plugin (up to version 4.2.5.7).
- Command Injection via the get_content function.
- The plugin uses call_user_func with user input.
- Allows unauthenticated attackers to execute any public function with one parameter.
- Potential result: remote code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted requests to the plugin.  
- Since WordPress plugins are typically accessible over the network (HTTP requests), the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description suggests straightforward exploitation by passing crafted input to a function.  
- No special conditions or environment needed.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is **unauthenticated**, meaning no privileges are required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can exploit this directly without requiring any user interaction.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code on the server hosting the plugin.  
- This affects the security of resources beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., the entire server).  
- This means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Remote code execution can lead to full disclosure of data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Remote code execution allows arbitrary code execution, which can modify or delete data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Remote code execution can disrupt service or delete files, causing denial of service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

#####654#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in JS Help Desk – Best Help Desk & Support Plugin. This issue affects JS Help Desk – Best Help Desk & Support Plugin: from n/a through 2.7.1.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** means an attacker can upload files without proper restrictions.
- This usually allows remote attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells).
- The vulnerability is in a web plugin, so the attack vector is likely over the network.
- No mention of authentication required, so likely no privileges required.
- User interaction is probably not required because the attacker can directly upload files.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the plugin).
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability depends on what the uploaded file can do. Usually, uploading a dangerous file can lead to full compromise (high impact).

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP upload).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  The description says "Unrestricted Upload," implying no special conditions or complexity.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  No mention of needing to be logged in or have privileges.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  The attacker can upload files directly; no user interaction needed.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the plugin itself, no indication that it affects other components or security authorities.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  
  Uploading a dangerous file (e.g., web shell) can lead to full data disclosure.

- **Integrity (I):** High (H)  
  The attacker can modify or replace files, leading to full integrity compromise.

- **Availability (A):** High (H)  
  The attacker can disrupt service by uploading malicious files (e.g., ransomware, destructive scripts).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a web parameter (`id` in a URL). This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection via a URL parameter typically requires no special conditions or timing, so the complexity is low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs to send a crafted request to the URL parameter. No authentication or privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker directly sends the malicious request; no user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.36

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 4.36, 10))  
= round_up(10.23) → 10.0 (max score is 10)

#####656#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress, versions up to 9.1.0
- Attack vector: Injection via shortcode attributes
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
- Impact: Arbitrary script execution when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely by submitting crafted shortcode attributes.  
- The attacker must be authenticated and have contributor-level permissions, but the injection is done remotely (via web interface).  
- The attack does not require physical or local access.  
- Since the attacker interacts over the network (HTTP requests), AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS via shortcode attributes, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor is a low-level role but still requires authentication.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The injected script executes when a user accesses the injected page.  
- The attacker cannot trigger the script execution themselves; it requires a victim user to view the page.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin and site).  
- No privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users who view the page.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying content or performing actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS typically does not affect availability directly.  
- No indication of denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via web interface |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | L     | Requires contributor-level authentication |
| UI     | R     | Requires victim user to view injected content |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, same security authority |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (data theft) |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact (content/script injection) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.05, 10))  
= round_up(4.56) = 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####657#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft version 2 when parsing the wKPFStringLen field of a DPS file. An anonymous attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file to achieve code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must get the user to open a specially crafted DPS file. This implies the attacker can deliver the file remotely (e.g., via email, download). The attack does not require physical or local access to the machine.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted DPS file, but no additional conditions or environment requirements are mentioned. Buffer overflow exploitation is generally straightforward once the file is crafted.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is anonymous and does not need any privileges on the target system before exploitation.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must open the specially crafted DPS file, so user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to code execution, which likely affects the same security scope (the application itself). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution typically allows full access to the application and potentially the system, so confidentiality impact is high.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows an attacker to modify data or system state arbitrarily.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can also disrupt availability (e.g., crashing the application or system).  
  **A = High (H)**

| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to vulnerable component           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Code execution leads to full confidentiality loss|
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Code execution leads to full integrity loss      |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Code execution leads to full availability loss   |

#####659#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Redaxo v5.15.1 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the component /pages/templates.php.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is a remote code execution via a web component. This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No indication that the attack requires special conditions or complex steps. Usually, RCE via a web component is straightforward if no special conditions are mentioned.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since it is a remote code execution vulnerability via a web component, it likely requires no privileges to exploit.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that user interaction is required for exploitation. RCE vulnerabilities in web components typically do not require user interaction.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  RCE usually allows the attacker to execute code in the context of the vulnerable component, which is part of the same security authority. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  RCE can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  RCE allows arbitrary code execution, so integrity is fully compromised.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  RCE can allow attacker to disrupt or destroy system availability.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | H     |

### Step 3: CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####660#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds write in Arm GPU Kernel Drivers.
- Impact: Local non-privileged user can cause improper GPU memory operations, potentially writing outside buffer bounds.
- Conditions: Requires local access, no privileges required, and some system memory preparation by the user.
- Affected components: Kernel drivers for Arm GPUs.
- Potential impact: Memory corruption, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on exploitation.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be local (non-privileged user on the system).  
- Not network or adjacent network.  
- So, AV:L (Local)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description says "if the system’s memory is carefully prepared by the user," indicating some non-trivial conditions to exploit.  
- This suggests higher complexity than just straightforward exploitation.  
- So, AC:H (High)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- "Local non-privileged user" means no privileges required.  
- So, PR:N (None)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of needing another user to do anything. The attacker is local and acts directly.  
- So, UI:N (None)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel driver, and the impact is on system memory.  
- Out-of-bounds write could affect other components beyond the vulnerable driver.  
- Kernel memory corruption typically affects the system beyond the vulnerable component, so scope is likely Changed.  
- So, S:C (Changed)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds write could lead to information disclosure if memory is read or leaked.  
- The description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact, but memory corruption can lead to info leaks.  
- Given the uncertainty, assign Low (L) for confidentiality.  
- So, C:L

**Integrity (I):**  
- Out-of-bounds write can modify memory, so integrity is impacted.  
- Likely Low or High depending on impact severity.  
- Since it is a kernel driver and can write outside buffer bounds, potentially high impact on integrity.  
- So, I:H

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause system crashes or denial of service.  
- So, availability impact is likely High.  
- So, A:H

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker required |
| AC     | H     | Requires careful memory preparation |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Kernel memory corruption affects system scope |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure |
| I      | H     | Memory write impacts integrity significantly |
| A      | H     | Potential system crash or DoS |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with these values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.175  
≈ 1.44

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.151]  
= 7.52 × 0.849  
≈ 6.39

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.39 + 1.44, 10])  
= Roundup (7.83)  
= 7.8

#####661#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via shortcode attributes.  
- Affected component: WCFM Marketplace plugin for WordPress (up to version 3.6.2).  
- Attack vector: Injection of scripts that execute when a user accesses the page.  
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions.  
- Impact: Arbitrary script execution in the context of users visiting the injected page.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely by submitting crafted shortcode attributes.  
- The attacker is authenticated and injects scripts that execute when other users visit the page.  
- The injection happens via web interface (HTTP request).  
- This is a network attack vector.  
**AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond having contributor-level access.  
- The attack is straightforward once privileges are obtained.  
**AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor-level is a low privilege role (not admin).  
**PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The injected script executes when a user accesses the injected page.  
- The attacker does not need to interact, but the victim user must visit the page for the script to execute.  
- This means user interaction is required (the victim must view the page).  
**UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin and user session).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- The impact is on the same scope (user session, WordPress environment).  
**S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the user.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
**C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
**I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- The vulnerability does not cause denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
**A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via HTTP request |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Requires contributor-level privileges |
| UI     | R     | Victim user must view the injected page |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (data exposure) |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact (script injection) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope=Unchanged)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Round up to nearest 0.1:**  
= Impact + Exploitability = 2.51 + 2.05 = 4.56 → 4.6 (Medium severity)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####662#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Electronic Delivery Check System (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries The Agriculture and Rural Development Project Version) March, Heisei 31 era edition Ver.14.0.001.002 and earlier.
- Vulnerability: Improper restriction of XML external entity references (XXE).
- Impact: By processing a specially crafted XML file, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the system.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability is exploited by processing a specially crafted XML file. Usually, XXE vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the system accepts XML input over the network. Since the description does not specify local access or physical access, and the system likely processes XML files received over a network or at least adjacent network, the most reasonable assumption is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted XML file to exploit the vulnerability. This is a common and straightforward attack for XXE, so the complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker only needs to send a crafted XML file; no mention of needing any privileges. So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
The attacker sends a crafted XML file to the system. No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary files on the system. This is a confidentiality impact on the same security authority (the system itself). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
The attacker can read arbitrary files on the system. This is a significant confidentiality impact but not total system compromise. Usually, this is rated as **High (H)** because arbitrary file reading can disclose sensitive information.

**Integrity (I):**  
No indication that the attacker can modify data. So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
No indication that the attacker can affect availability. So, **None (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: High (H)  
- I: None (N)  
- A: None (N)  

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 4.37, 10)) = round_up(7.97) = 8.0

#####663#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The Coru LFMember WordPress plugin (up to version 1.0.2) lacks CSRF protection when adding a new game.
- It also lacks sanitization and escaping in settings.
- This allows an attacker to make a logged-in admin add an arbitrary game with XSS payloads.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves exploiting a CSRF vulnerability and XSS via the plugin's settings.  
- The attacker must trick a logged-in admin to perform an action.  
- The attacker can be remote (over the network) since CSRF attacks typically happen via crafted web requests.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires the victim (admin) to be logged in and to perform an action (click a link or visit a page).  
- This is a typical CSRF scenario, which is considered low complexity because no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need privileges themselves but needs a logged-in admin to perform the action.  
- Since the attacker must rely on a logged-in admin, the attacker has no privileges, but the victim must have high privileges.  
- PR is from the attacker's perspective, so PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the admin to perform an action (e.g., click a link or visit a malicious page).  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to add arbitrary games with XSS payloads in the plugin's settings.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (the WordPress plugin environment).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows XSS payloads to be injected, which can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This implies a Low confidentiality impact (some data may be exposed).  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can add arbitrary games with malicious payloads, modifying data.  
- This is a Low integrity impact (data can be modified but not fully controlled or destroyed).  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- A = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via CSRF |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | Attacker requires no privileges |
| UI     | R     | Requires user interaction (admin action) |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | L     | XSS leads to some confidentiality loss |
| I      | L     | Data can be modified (adding games) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.68)  
= round_up(5.19)  
= 5.2 (Medium severity)

#####664#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Skyworth Router CM5100, version 4.1.1.24.
- Insufficient validation of user input for the "Preshared Phrase" parameter on the web interface.
- Remote attacker can supply specially crafted input via the web interface.
- Successful exploitation allows stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, which is typically straightforward to exploit.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and supplies input to the web interface.  
- Usually, web interfaces allow unauthenticated access to certain parameters, especially for preshared phrases or Wi-Fi settings.  
- The description does not mention needing authentication.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker supplies input directly to the web interface.  
- No mention of needing another user to perform any action.  
- Stored XSS means the payload is stored and executed when a user views the page, so user interaction is required for the XSS payload to execute.  
- However, for the vulnerability to be exploited (i.e., to inject the payload), no user interaction is needed.  
- CVSS UI metric refers to whether the attacker needs another user to do something to exploit the vulnerability.  
- Since the attacker can inject the payload without user interaction, but the XSS payload executes when a victim views the page, **UI is Required (R)** because the attack's impact (script execution) requires a user to view the page.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the web interface of the router.  
- The impact is on the same component (the web interface/system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This implies a **Low (L)** confidentiality impact because it can leak some information but not necessarily full system compromise.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS allows an attacker to execute scripts in the context of the victim, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a **Low (L)** integrity impact because it can modify data or actions in the context of the user but not the system itself.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- No mention of denial of service or disruption.  
- **Value: None (N)**

| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible leakage of sensitive information (cookies, tokens)                               |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of content or actions in user context                               |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                  |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836 (approx)

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515 (approx)

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 2.836)  
= Round_up (5.351)  
= 5.4

#####665#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions before 2.8.1.  
- Allows an authenticated user to access the source code of a DAG they shouldn't have access to.  
- Requires authentication (an authenticated user).  
- Considered low severity.  
- No mention of user interaction required beyond authentication.  
- The attack is likely performed remotely (network).  
- The impact is unauthorized information disclosure (source code access).  
- No mention of integrity or availability impact.

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network (e.g., via the Airflow web interface).  
   **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   No special conditions or complexity mentioned; the attacker just needs to be authenticated.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   The attacker must be an authenticated user, so some privileges are required, but not high privileges.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   No mention that another user must perform any action for the exploit to succeed. The attacker is authenticated and can perform the action themselves.  
   **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   The vulnerability allows access to source code of a DAG the user doesn't have access to, but it is within the same security authority (same Airflow instance). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
   **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   The attacker can access source code they shouldn't see, which is an unauthorized disclosure of information. The description says the vulnerability is low severity, so the impact is likely Low rather than High.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   No indication that the attacker can modify data or code.  
   **Value:** None (N)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10)) = round_up(4.09) = 4.1

According to CVSS v3.1 rounding rules, the base score is 4.1, which is a **Medium** severity score.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Totolink LR1200GB firmware version 9.1.0u.6619_B20230130.
- Affected function: setParentalRules in /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi.
- The issue: manipulation of the argument sTime leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Vendor did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is launched remotely.
- The vulnerable function is accessible via a CGI script, which implies network access.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.
- No mention of special conditions or environment requirements.
- Usually, buffer overflow via argument manipulation is straightforward.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attack is launched remotely against a CGI script.
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends a crafted request to the CGI script.
- No mention that a user must perform any action.
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in a web service.
- Usually, buffer overflow in a process leads to code execution or crash within the same security scope.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.
- No explicit mention of data disclosure.
- However, buffer overflow can potentially lead to information disclosure.
- Since the description does not mention data leak, but the exploit is critical, assume at least Low impact on confidentiality.
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- Buffer overflow can allow code execution or modification of data.
- This implies at least Low impact on integrity.
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.
- Therefore, at least Low impact on availability.
- Therefore, A = Low (L).

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.474  
= 0.526

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.526  
= 3.38

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.26)  
= 7.3

#####667#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Use after free in Passwords in Google Chrome prior to 121.0.6167.85 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via specific UI interaction. (Chromium security severity: Medium)"

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and exploits via UI interaction, so the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description mentions "specific UI interaction," which implies some conditions must be met, but nothing too complex or high. Usually, "specific UI interaction" suggests a bit more than trivial but not high complexity. Given the medium severity and typical Chrome bugs, this is likely **Low (L)** complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and no mention of needing privileges on the system. Usually, remote exploitation in Chrome means no privileges required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description explicitly says "via specific UI interaction," so user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  Use after free in Chrome's Passwords component could lead to heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Since the vulnerability is within Chrome and the impact is on the same component (no indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component), the scope is likely **Unchanged (U)**.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact. Given the medium severity, assume **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow modification of data or code, so integrity impact is likely **Low (L)**.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service, so availability impact is likely **Low (L)**.  
  **A = Low (L)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 1 - 0.474 ≈ 0.526

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(3.38 + 2.84, 10))  
= Roundup(6.22) = 6.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L**

#####668#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via image URLs in a WordPress plugin.
- Affected component: Timeline Widget For Elementor plugin, versions up to 1.5.3.
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes.
- Attackers: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions.
- Impact: Inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page and interacts with the slideshow widget.

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by submitting malicious input through the plugin interface, which is a web application component.  
- The attacker must be authenticated and interact with the plugin via the web interface.  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the required permissions.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor-level or above permissions (authenticated user with some privileges).  
- Contributor is a low-level privilege in WordPress, but it is not "None".  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the attacker to inject the script (no user interaction needed for the attacker).  
- However, the script executes when any user accesses the injected page and interacts with the slideshow widget (changing slideshow type and back).  
- The victim user must interact with the page to trigger the script execution.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope: the WordPress plugin and the WordPress application.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the user.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- No indication of denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

---

### Summary of Metrics

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.04

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[2.51 + 2.04, 10]) = Roundup(4.55) = 4.6 (Medium)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Multiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed in macOS Sonoma 14.3, iOS 16.7.5 and iPadOS 16.7.5, iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3. Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content. This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network (e.g., via a browser or network service).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Processing crafted web content is usually straightforward.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attacker only needs to supply malicious web content, no privileges on the target system are required.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the user to process (e.g., open or visit) the malicious web content. This implies user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution, likely within the same security scope (e.g., the browser or application sandbox). No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full data disclosure. So confidentiality impact is High.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt availability (e.g., crash or denial of service). So availability impact is High.  
  **A = High (H)**

| Scope (S)            | U       | No scope change indicated                        |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H       | Arbitrary code execution leads to full disclosure|
| Integrity (I)        | H       | Arbitrary code execution allows full modification|
| Availability (A)     | H       | Arbitrary code execution can cause denial of service|

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 = 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(8.7) = 8.7

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **8.7** (High severity).

#####670#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In the Linux kernel, a memory leak in the media: staging/intel-ipu3 driver was fixed. The issue was due to losing the reference to an allocated memory, which was resolved by changing the order of a check.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Memory leak (resource management issue)
- **Component:** Linux kernel driver (media: staging/intel-ipu3)
- **Impact:** Memory leak (losing reference to allocated memory)
- **Exploitability:** Not explicitly stated, but since it's a kernel driver, likely requires local access or specific conditions.
- **Scope:** The vulnerability is in a kernel driver, so it could potentially affect the kernel's state or other components.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS base metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a kernel driver.  
- Usually, kernel driver vulnerabilities require local access to the system or at least adjacent network access if the driver is exposed via network interfaces.  
- Since this is a media driver (likely related to hardware/media devices), exploitation probably requires local access.  
- **Value:** Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a memory leak due to a coding error (losing reference).  
- No indication that exploitation requires special conditions or timing.  
- Memory leaks are generally straightforward to trigger once local access is obtained.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel driver, to interact with it, the attacker likely needs some privileges.  
- However, some media drivers can be accessed by unprivileged users (e.g., via device files in /dev).  
- Without explicit info, assume low privileges are required (e.g., normal user).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker likely triggers the leak by interacting with the driver directly.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel driver, and a memory leak could affect the kernel's memory.  
- This could impact components beyond the vulnerable driver (kernel memory).  
- Therefore, scope is likely changed (C).  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory leak typically does not directly disclose sensitive information.  
- No mention of data disclosure.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory leak does not directly modify data or code.  
- No indication of integrity impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing denial of service.  
- So, availability impact is Low (system performance degradation or crash possible).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to interact with driver |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions needed |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges (normal user) needed |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Kernel memory affected, scope changed |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Memory leak can cause availability degradation |

Employee Management System v1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability via the id parameter at /edit.php.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a web parameter (`id` at `/edit.php`), so the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL injection vulnerabilities typically require no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges. Usually, SQLi on a public parameter implies no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the malicious input directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  SQL injection usually affects the database and the application itself, not other components or systems. The scope is likely unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL injection can lead to data disclosure. Since the description does not specify the extent, but SQLi generally allows reading data, assign Low (L).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL injection can allow modification of data. Without explicit mention of full control, assign Low (L).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL injection can sometimes cause denial of service, but no mention here. Assign None (N).  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.99

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.99, 10)) = round_up(6.5) = 6.5

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The attacker is remote and sends specially crafted requests.  
   - Value: **Network (N)**

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   The vulnerability is due to unsafe deserialization, which usually requires crafting a specific payload but no special conditions or timing.  
   - Value: **Low (L)**

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   The attacker must be authenticated (remote authenticated attacker). This implies some privileges are required, but not high privileges.  
   - Value: **Low (L)**

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   No mention of user interaction required; the attacker sends a request directly.  
   - Value: **None (N)**

5. **Scope (S):**

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)  

---

### Calculate Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(8.56) = 8.6 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place, but the official calculator rounds to nearest 0.1)

The official CVSS calculator would give a base score of **8.6** (High severity).

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####673#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
EDK2's Network Package has a buffer overflow vulnerability via a long server ID option in DHCPv6 client. This can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access and potentially cause loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and/or Availability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited via a network protocol (DHCPv6).  
- The attacker can send a specially crafted DHCPv6 packet remotely.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Buffer overflow via a long server ID option suggests the attack is straightforward and does not require special conditions.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker exploits the DHCPv6 client remotely, no mention of needing any privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a malicious DHCPv6 packet; no user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the DHCPv6 client component of EDK2's Network Package.  
- Exploitation leads to unauthorized access and potential loss of C, I, A.  
- Since the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the DHCPv6 client component), and no indication that the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from one component to another), Scope is likely Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description says "potentially lead to a loss of Confidentiality."  
- So, Confidentiality impact is at least Low (L).  
- Since it says "potentially," and not full disclosure, we assign Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Similarly, "potentially lead to a loss of Integrity."  
- Assign Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- "potentially lead to a loss of Availability."  
- Assign Low (L).

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via DHCPv6 |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward buffer overflow |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | L     | Potential loss of confidentiality |
| I      | L     | Potential loss of integrity |
| A      | L     | Potential loss of availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.4746  
= 0.5254

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.5254  
= 3.37

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.37 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (7.26)  
= 7.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in CU Solutions Group (CUSG) Content Management System (CMS) before v.7.75 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the login.php component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a crafted script sent to a web component (login.php). This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; XSS typically requires crafting a script but no special environment or conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and can send a crafted script to the login page, implying no prior privileges are needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS usually requires the victim user to interact with the malicious script (e.g., by visiting a malicious page or clicking a link). Since the vulnerability is in login.php, the victim likely needs to load or interact with the page containing the malicious script.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, and data disclosure. Since the vulnerability is in a web application component and affects the application’s security properties, but there is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope (e.g., the underlying OS or other components), the scope is likely unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can obtain sensitive information. This indicates a **High** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges, which implies the ability to modify data or system state. This is a **High** impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

Since Scope is Unchanged (U),  
Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score:**  
= Round to 1 decimal place the minimum of (Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 5.18 + 2.84 = 8.02 → 8.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue in HummerRisk HummerRisk v.1.10 thru 1.4.1 allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request to the service/LicenseService component."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted request to a service component. This implies the attack can be performed remotely over a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. The attacker just needs to send a crafted request.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated, so some privileges are required. The description says "authenticated attacker" but does not specify if low or high privileges are needed. Usually, "authenticated attacker" implies at least low privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted request directly to the service. No user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution on the service component. Usually, code execution in the same component implies the scope is unchanged. There's no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution typically allows full access to data, so confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the service, so availability impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.274 ≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 × 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(8.12)  
= 8.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####676#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Affects: WP Booking Calendar plugin before version 9.7.4
- Impact: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation allows stored XSS.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Stored XSS in a web plugin is typically exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- **AV:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input that gets stored and later rendered. No complex conditions or timing needed.  
- **AC:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
Stored XSS in a web plugin often requires no privileges to exploit; an attacker can submit malicious input as an unauthenticated user or any user with input capability. The description does not specify any authentication requirement.  
- **PR:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
For stored XSS, the attacker stores malicious script that executes when a victim views the page. The victim (user) must view the page for the script to execute, so user interaction is required.  
- **UI:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
Stored XSS affects the same security scope (the web application). It does not escalate privileges or affect other components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser, so confidentiality impact is Low or High depending on context. Usually, it is considered Low because it depends on the victim's interaction and what data is accessible.  
- **C:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
Stored XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content seen by users, which affects integrity of displayed data.  
- **I:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
Stored XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- **A:** None (N)

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible smart contract function |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions mentioned |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to invoke function |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service causes high availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.476  
≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.59

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U):

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(7.5)  
= 7.5

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **7.5**.

### Calculating CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085184  
  = 0.914816

- Impact (since Scope is Unchanged) = 6.42 * Impact  
  = 6.42 * 0.914816  
  = 5.874

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556325

#####679#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Synopsys Seeker versions prior to 2023.12.0 are vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability through a specially crafted payload."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Vulnerability type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Attack vector:** Typically, XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely via the network (e.g., through a web interface).  
- **Privileges required:** Usually none, as XSS attacks often target users of the application, not requiring attacker privileges on the system.  
- **User interaction:** Required, because the victim must interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a malicious page or view stored content).  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Impact:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low or High depending on what the XSS can access. Usually, XSS can steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user, so at least Low confidentiality impact.  
  - Integrity: Low, as the attacker can inject scripts that may modify data or perform actions.  
  - Availability: Usually None or Low, as XSS rarely causes denial of service.

---

### Step 2: Assign metric values

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  XSS vulnerabilities generally have low complexity; the attacker just needs to send a crafted payload.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the system.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact with the malicious payload (e.g., view the stored XSS content).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  The attacker can steal user data or session tokens, but not full system data.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  The attacker can inject scripts that may modify data or perform actions.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  XSS typically does not affect availability.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Remote network attack                           |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Low complexity to exploit                      |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | Victim must interact with malicious payload    |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Same security scope                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial data disclosure possible                |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Partial modification possible                    |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                        |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.51 + 2.68)  
= Round_up (5.19)  
= 5.2 (Medium severity)

### Step 3: CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H**

#####681#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The Formidable Forms WordPress plugin before 6.2 unserializes user input, which could allow anonymous users to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable by "anonymous users" and involves user input, which implies it can be exploited remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description states "when a suitable gadget is present," which implies some conditions must be met for exploitation (finding or having a gadget). This adds complexity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "anonymous," meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is anonymous and can send crafted input directly. No user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  PHP Object Injection in a plugin can lead to code execution or impact beyond the vulnerable component, but the description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component. Usually, plugin vulnerabilities affect the same scope (WordPress instance).  
  Since the vulnerability affects the plugin and the impact is within the same security scope (WordPress environment), scope is likely **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  PHP Object Injection can lead to data disclosure depending on the gadget used. Since the description does not specify full data disclosure, but the potential is there, assign **High (H)** to reflect the worst case.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  PHP Object Injection can allow code execution or modification of data, so integrity is likely **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Such injection can also lead to denial of service or disruption, so availability impact is likely **High (H)**.

---

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network by anonymous users |
| AC     | H     | Requires suitable gadget, increasing complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required (anonymous user) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope (plugin/WordPress) |
| C      | H     | Potential for full data disclosure via object injection |
| I      | H     | Potential for full integrity compromise |
| A      | H     | Potential for full availability impact |

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.318  
= 8.22 * 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score = Impact + Exploitability**  
= 5.88 + 2.22  
= 8.10

Since Scope is Unchanged, no further adjustment.

Round up to one decimal place: **8.1**

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via crafted API requests, which implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit.  
- OS command injection via API requests is typically straightforward if the API is accessible.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description states "allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted API requests."  
- It does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, it would be specified.  
- Therefore, assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is performed by sending crafted API requests.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of unauthorized code or commands.  
- If the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (e.g., affects other components or system-level resources), scope is changed.  
- OS command injection typically allows impact beyond the vulnerable component, affecting the system.  
- Therefore, **Scope: Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- OS command injection can lead to unauthorized access to data or system information.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but code execution often implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Assign **High (H)** because arbitrary code execution can lead to full data disclosure.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unauthorized code execution allows modification of data or system state.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Unauthorized code execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., by deleting files, stopping services).  
- **Value:** High (H)

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The description mentions "cloud provider" and "integration and deployment" for devices.  
- The attacker needs access to "internal procedures," which suggests the attacker must be inside the network or have some form of internal access.  
- Since it is not explicitly stated that the attacker can exploit this remotely over the internet, but "internal procedures" implies adjacency or local access.  
- Given the cloud context, "internal procedures" likely means internal network access, so **Adjacent (A)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description says "insufficiently protected," implying low complexity to exploit.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have "access to internal procedures."  
- This implies some level of privilege or access already.  
- Since the attacker is not completely unauthenticated (PR:N), but has some access, this suggests **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of needing a user to perform any action.  
- The attacker can access internal procedures directly.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the cloud provider's integration and deployment system, which impacts multiple devices.  
- The attacker can view source code, secret credentials, and more, which likely affects resources beyond the initially vulnerable component.  
- This suggests a change in scope.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can view source code and secret credentials.  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention modification of data or code, only viewing.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of disruption or denial of service.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Attacker needs internal/adjacent network access |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, insufficient protection |
| PR     | L     | Attacker needs some privileges (access to internal procedures) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact affects resources beyond initial component |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (source code, credentials) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact mentioned |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 1 × 1) = 0.56

Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.56 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.56 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.531 - 3.25 × (0.54)^15  
= 3.99 - 3.25 × very small number  
≈ 3.99

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= Roundup(min(1.08 × (3.99 + 2.05), 10))  
= Roundup(min(1.08 × 6.04, 10))  
= Roundup(6.52) = 7.0

#####684#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
An issue in Dlink DIR-816A2 v.1.10CNB05 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the wizardstep4_ssid_2 parameter in the sub_42DA54 function.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and exploits a parameter (wizardstep4_ssid_2) likely via network communication.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; arbitrary code execution via a parameter suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can execute arbitrary code via a parameter, implying no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the exploit.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Arbitrary code execution on the device itself suggests the scope is unchanged (the impact is within the vulnerable component).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution typically allows full access to data, so confidentiality impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or disable the device, so availability impact is High.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | H     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.08

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 4.08, 10))  
= round_up(9.95)  
= 9.9 (rounded to 10.0 in CVSS calculators)

**Final Base Score:** 9.9 (High severity)

#####685#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A heap buffer-overflow exists in Delta Electronics ISPSoft. An anonymous attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DVP file to achieve code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must entice a user to open a specially crafted file. This implies the attacker does not need local access or physical access, but the user must open a file, likely delivered via network (e.g., email, download). Since the attacker can be remote and the file can be delivered over a network, the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted file, but no special conditions or timing are mentioned. This is a typical file-based exploit with no unusual conditions. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is anonymous and does not require any privileges on the target system. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must open the specially crafted file. This requires user interaction. So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to code execution. Usually, code execution in the same software component means the scope is **Unchanged (U)** unless the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. Since no indication of scope change is given, assume **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution typically allows full control, including reading sensitive data. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows modification of data. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can disrupt availability. So, **High (H)**.

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####687#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in RoboSoft Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery: from n/a through 3.2.17.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely via the web interface (Network).  
- **Attack Complexity:** Typically low for stored XSS because the attacker just needs to inject the payload once, and it executes for any user who views the page.  
- **Privileges Required:** None, as the attacker only needs to submit malicious input (e.g., via a form or upload).  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must view the malicious content for the script to execute.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, or other data accessible to the browser)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify the content displayed to the user)  
  - Availability: None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

---

### Step 2: Assign metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable over the network (web interface)                                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Low complexity; no special conditions required                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  | No privileges required to inject malicious input                                         |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must view the malicious content for the script to execute                            |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects resources within the same security scope                           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Partial disclosure of information (e.g., cookies, session tokens)                         |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Partial modification of data (e.g., page content)                                        |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability                                                                |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.4

### Final summary:

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

#####688#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The issue involves Xen hypervisor running PV (paravirtualized) guests in shadow paging mode.
- The vulnerability arises when shadow page tables are torn down due to memory shortage.
- The tearing down may include the shadow root page table currently in use by the CPU.
- There is a precaution to prevent tearing down the live page table, but the time window is insufficient.
- This implies a potential for memory corruption or instability in the hypervisor or guest.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The attack involves PV guests running on Xen.
- The vulnerability is in the hypervisor's handling of shadow page tables.
- Exploitation likely requires the attacker to be a guest user or have some access to the PV guest.
- Since the attacker must be inside a PV guest to trigger this, the attack vector is **Adjacent (A)** (within the same host or network segment, not remote over the internet).
- **AV:A**

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The vulnerability depends on a timing window and memory shortage conditions.
- This suggests the attack is not trivial and requires specific conditions.
- Therefore, **High (H)** complexity.
- **AC:H**

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- The attacker must be running code inside a PV guest.
- The description does not specify if root or unprivileged user is needed.
- Since the attacker must be inside the guest, but no mention of needing elevated privileges, assume **Low (L)** privileges.
- **PR:L**

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The attack is performed by the attacker controlling the PV guest.
- No indication that another user must interact.
- **None (N)**
- **UI:N**

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability affects the hypervisor (Xen) and potentially the guest.
- The vulnerability in the hypervisor can affect the guest's memory isolation.
- This means a change in scope from guest to hypervisor or vice versa.
- **Changed (C)**
- **S:C**

#### Confidentiality (C)
- Potential for memory corruption or exposure of data.
- The description implies possible leakage or corruption of memory.
- Assign **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.
- **C:L**

#### Integrity (I)
- Memory corruption implies integrity impact.
- Assign **Low (L)** integrity impact.
- **I:L**

#### Availability (A)
- Tearing down the live page table can cause crashes or instability.
- Assign **Low (L)** availability impact.
- **A:L**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Attacker must be in PV guest (adjacent) |
| AC     | H     | Timing and memory shortage conditions required |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges inside guest required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses from guest to hypervisor (scope changed) |
| C      | L     | Possible data exposure or leakage |
| I      | L     | Memory corruption affects integrity |
| A      | L     | Potential crashes or instability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:A = 0.62
- AC:H = 0.44
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.44 * 0.68 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.158  
≈ 1.30

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 7.52 * 0.526  
= 3.95

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else, since Scope Changed:  
BaseScore = round_up (min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up (1.08 * (3.95 + 1.30))  
= round_up (1.08 * 5.25)  
= round_up (5.67)  
= 5.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.0977 ≈ 0.803

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 0.803, 10))  
= round_up(4.398)  
= 4.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary content of the results database via a crafted HTTP request."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and uses an HTTP request, which is over the network.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just sends a crafted HTTP request. This implies low complexity.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request directly; no user interaction is needed.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary content of the results database. The database is likely part of the same security authority as the vulnerable component (e.g., the web server). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  Therefore, scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can read arbitrary content of the database, which is a confidentiality impact. Since the attacker can read arbitrary content, this is a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description only mentions reading data, no modification.  
  **I:N (None)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of disruption or denial of service.  
  **A:N (None)**

| PR     | N     | Attacker unauthenticated |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | No scope change indicated |
| C      | H     | Arbitrary read of database content |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or a trusted calculator:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score:**  
= Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.595 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (7.485)  
= 7.5

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | H     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**

= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact Score = 6.42 * Impact**

= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**

= Roundup(Min[5.88 + 3.89, 10])  
= Roundup(9.77) = 9.8

Rounded to one decimal place: **9.8**

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####692#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"In video decoder, there is a possible out of bounds read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a video decoder, which typically processes input files. The description does not specify remote exploitation or network access, but since it involves input validation, the attacker likely needs to provide a crafted video file.  
  Usually, video decoders are local components, and the attacker must have the file locally or send it through an application. Since the description does not mention network or adjacent network exploitation, and the attack is local, the vector is **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is due to improper input validation leading to an out-of-bounds read. This suggests the attack is straightforward once the attacker has the input file. No special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
  Therefore, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "no additional execution privileges needed," meaning the attacker does not need any privileges beyond what is required to run the video decoder.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker must provide a crafted video file to the decoder, which implies the user must open or play the malicious file. This requires user interaction.  
  Therefore, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to a local denial of service (DoS). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes privileges.  
  So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description mentions an out-of-bounds read, which could potentially leak information. However, the description only mentions denial of service, not information disclosure.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description explicitly states "local denial of service," which impacts availability. The impact is likely to be **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on severity. Since it is a DoS caused by an out-of-bounds read, which usually crashes the application, it is typically **High (H)** availability impact.  
  So, **High (H)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local access needed to provide crafted input   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploitation                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must open/play crafted video file          |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to vulnerable component          |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No info disclosure mentioned                     |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                              |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Local DoS causing crash or service disruption   |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.59

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.42)  
= 5.4 (Medium severity)

#####693#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Skyworth Router CM5100 v4.1.1.24.
- Insufficient validation of user input for the DDNS Username parameter at the web interface.
- Remote attacker can supply specially crafted input via the web interface.
- Successful exploitation allows stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- Web interface is accessible over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply specially crafted input to a parameter.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and can supply input to the web interface.  
- Usually, web interfaces allow unauthenticated access to certain parameters like DDNS Username.  
- The description does not mention needing authentication.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Stored XSS requires a victim user to visit a page or interact with the stored malicious script.  
- The attacker stores the malicious script, but for the impact to occur, another user must trigger the script by viewing the page.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the web interface of the router.  
- The impact is on the same component (the router's web interface).  
- Stored XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users interacting with the web interface.  
- This results in some loss of confidentiality.  
- Usually, stored XSS is rated as Low (L) confidentiality impact.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This can be considered a Low (L) integrity impact.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A = None (N).

| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Some loss of confidentiality due to script execution.                                    |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Some loss of integrity due to script execution.                                          |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability.                                                               |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.344  
≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (S:U),  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.51 + 2.83)  
= Roundup (5.34)  
= 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Incorrect security UI in Payments in Google Chrome prior to 121.0.6167.85 allowed a remote attacker to potentially spoof security UI via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: Medium)

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a crafted HTML page, which implies the attack can be performed remotely over the network (e.g., via a web page).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to craft an HTML page. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and presumably does not need any privileges on the victim's machine to exploit this.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Since the attacker needs the victim to visit or interact with a crafted HTML page, user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is about spoofing security UI in the Payments component of Chrome. Spoofing UI can lead to a change in the security state perceived by the user but does it affect components beyond the vulnerable component?  
  Usually, UI spoofing vulnerabilities do not change the scope because the impact is within the same security authority boundary (the browser).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention data disclosure or leakage. Spoofing UI may trick users but does not directly disclose confidential information.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can spoof UI, which may mislead the user but does not directly modify data or code integrity.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No impact on availability is described.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote attack via crafted HTML page |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact with crafted page |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

#####697#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
"AMI’s SPx contains a vulnerability in the BMC where an Attacker may cause a heap memory corruption via an adjacent network. A successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability."

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metric Values

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is via an "adjacent network."  
  **Value:** Adjacent (A)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; heap memory corruption via adjacent network suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker causes heap corruption via adjacent network; no mention of needing privileges. Usually, network attacks with no mention of privileges imply none.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller), which is a separate component from the main OS. Heap corruption in BMC likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself, so scope is likely changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description says "may lead to a loss of confidentiality."  
  **Value:** Low (L) (since it says "may lead to loss," not necessarily total loss)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  "may lead to a loss of integrity"  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  "may lead to a loss of availability"  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | A     | Adjacent network                                |

### Step 3: Construct CVSS v3.1 Vector String

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

---

### Step 4: Calculate Base Score (Optional)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:A (0.62)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:L (0.22)

Calculating Impact:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.4745  
= 0.5255

Since Scope is Changed:

Impact_S = 7.52 * (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 * (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.5255 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.5255 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.4965 - 3.25 * (0.5055)^15  
= 3.733 - 3.25 * very small number  
≈ 3.733 (since (0.5055)^15 is very small)

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.345  
= 2.837

Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact_S + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (3.733 + 2.837), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 6.57, 10))  
= round_up(7.09)  
= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

---

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 7.1 (High)

---

### Final Output:

Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A)  
Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  
Privileges Required (PR): None (N)  
User Interaction (UI): None (N)  
Scope (S): Changed (C)  
Confidentiality (C): Low (L)  
Integrity (I): Low (L)  
Availability (A): Low (L)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in WooCommerce plugin (before 4.7.2).
- Exploitation: By echoing a GET value in an admin note within the WooCommerce orders page.
- Required privileges: User must have the **edit_others_shop_orders** capability.
- WooCommerce must be installed and active.
- The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization (double encoding issue).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted GET request.
- The vulnerability is reflected in the admin interface.
- The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network (HTTP request).
- However, the victim must be an authenticated user with specific privileges.
- Since the attacker sends a request over the network, and the victim must interact with it, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is a reflected XSS that requires crafting a specific GET parameter.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- The description does not mention any complex conditions.
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must have the **edit_others_shop_orders** capability.
- This is a specific WordPress capability, which is not granted to all users.
- This implies the attacker must be an authenticated user with **low privileges** (not admin necessarily, but some elevated privileges).
- In CVSS, "Low" means some privileges but not full admin.
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The vulnerability is reflected in an admin note within the WooCommerce orders page.
- The victim (user with edit_others_shop_orders capability) must visit the crafted URL or interact with the malicious GET parameter.
- This means user interaction is **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the WooCommerce plugin and WordPress environment).
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Reflected XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user.
- However, since the attacker is already an authenticated user with some privileges, the impact on confidentiality is **Low (L)** (some data may be exposed or stolen).

**Integrity (I):**

- XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or modify data.
- This can lead to modification of data or commands executed in the context of the user.
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**

- XSS generally does not impact availability.
- No indication of DoS or availability impact.
- So, **None (N)**.

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####699#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In rds_recv_track_latency in net/rds/af_rds.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there is an off-by-one error for an RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX comparison, resulting in out-of-bounds access.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is an off-by-one error causing out-of-bounds access.
- It is in the Linux kernel networking subsystem (RDS - Reliable Datagram Sockets).
- The function affected is `rds_recv_track_latency`.
- The impact is an out-of-bounds access, which could lead to memory corruption.
- The description does not explicitly mention remote exploitation or local exploitation, but since it is in the networking code, it is likely exploitable remotely.
- No mention of user interaction.
- No explicit mention of privilege requirements.
- The impact is likely on confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to memory corruption.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since the vulnerability is in the network stack (net/rds), it is exploitable over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Off-by-one errors are generally straightforward to exploit if reachable.  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the network receive path.  
- Typically, network vulnerabilities in the kernel can be triggered by sending specially crafted packets without privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker can send crafted network packets.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on kernel memory.  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel's internal state, which is outside the scope of the vulnerable component (network subsystem).  
- Kernel vulnerabilities usually imply scope change because the impact crosses component boundaries (from network subsystem to kernel memory).  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds access can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention info disclosure, but out-of-bounds read is possible.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to modification of data.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for availability.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.474]  
= 7.52 * 0.526  
≈ 3.95

**Base Score:**  
= If Impact <= 0, then 0, else:  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (3.95 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (7.84)  
= 7.8

#####700#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Use after free in Bookmarks in Google Chrome prior to 123.0.6312.105 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is via a crafted HTML page, which implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network (e.g., by convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Use-after-free vulnerabilities exploited via crafted HTML pages are generally straightforward once the victim visits the page.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the victim's machine to exploit the vulnerability.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the victim to visit a crafted HTML page, so user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the Chrome browser's bookmarks component. Exploiting heap corruption could lead to code execution or other impacts within the browser process. Usually, use-after-free in a browser component affects the same security scope (the browser process).  
  No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the browser process or changes security scope.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap corruption can lead to information disclosure. The severity is high, so likely at least Low or High confidentiality impact. Since the description says "potentially exploit heap corruption," which can lead to information disclosure, but no explicit mention of full data disclosure, we assign:  
  **C = High (H)** (Given the "Chromium security severity: High" and typical impact of use-after-free)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow an attacker to modify memory, leading to integrity impact.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **A = High (H)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote attack via crafted HTML page |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must visit crafted page |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope (browser) |
| C      | H     | Potential for high confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Potential for high integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Potential for high availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Round_up(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Round_up(Min(5.88 + 2.84, 10))  
= Round_up(8.72) = 8.7 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds to one decimal place, and 8.72 rounds to 8.7, but the official calculator rounds up to 9.0 for this vector)

However, the official CVSS calculator for these values gives a base score of **8.8 (High)**.

#####701#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- PrestaShop before version 8.1.3 has a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The vulnerability allows storing a malicious payload in the database.
- The impact is low because the backend (BO) escapes HTML, so no impact there.
- The frontend (FO) is vulnerable, but the XSS only affects the customer who sent the payload or their own session.
- The vulnerability requires a module that fetches and displays these messages without escaping HTML.
- The attack vector is likely remote (network).
- The attack impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability only of the attacker’s own session/customer, not others.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is exploitable by sending data that gets stored in the database.
- The attacker can send this data remotely (e.g., via web form).
- So, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack requires the attacker to store a payload in the database.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- The description does not mention any complex conditions.
- So, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is a customer who can send messages.
- No mention of needing special privileges.
- So, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires the victim (the same customer) to view the malicious payload.
- The victim is the attacker themselves or their own session.
- The attacker must trigger the payload by viewing it.
- So, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects only the attacker’s own session.
- No impact beyond the vulnerable component.
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can execute script in their own session.
- No impact on other users’ confidentiality.
- So, Confidentiality impact is Low (L) because the attacker can access their own data or session info.

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can execute script in their own session.
- This could allow modification of their own data or actions.
- So, Integrity impact is Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- The attacker could potentially disrupt their own session.
- No impact on other users or system availability.
- So, Availability impact is Low (L).

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network                                                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required                                                                    |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | Victim (attacker themselves) must view the payload                                        |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable component (attacker’s own session)                        |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Attacker can access their own data                                                        |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Attacker can modify their own data                                                        |
| Availability (A)     | L     | Attacker can disrupt their own session                                                    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1-C)*(1-I)*(1-A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1-0.22)*(1-0.22)*(1-0.22))

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78*0.78*0.78)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.475)

= 6.42 * 0.525 ≈ 3.37

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

= round_up(min(3.37 + 2.84, 10)) = round_up(6.21) = 6.2

#####702#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
QStar Archive Solutions Release RELEASE_3-0 Build 7 Patch 0 contains a DOM Based reflected XSS vulnerability within the component qnme-ajax?method=tree_table.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Vulnerability type:** DOM Based reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Component:** qnme-ajax?method=tree_table
- **Effect:** Allows injection of malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via a crafted URL or HTTP request).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Reflected DOM XSS usually requires the attacker to craft a specific URL or input, but no special conditions or timing are needed.  
- Complexity is low.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system to exploit reflected XSS.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Reflected XSS requires the victim to interact, typically by clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted URL.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- DOM Based XSS affects the client-side environment (browser), but the vulnerability is in the web application.  
- The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- The scope remains unchanged.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Successful exploitation can lead to theft of sensitive information accessible to the browser (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject and execute scripts, potentially modifying data or actions performed by the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (click link) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.33) = 5.3

#####703#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.2.5.5 does not sanitise and escape user input before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted link to the victim, who then clicks it. The attack is delivered over the network (e.g., via a URL).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS usually has low complexity because the attacker just needs to craft a malicious URL and trick the user into clicking it. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the system to perform the attack; the victim user is the one who must have privileges (e.g., admin). The attacker just sends a malicious link.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must click the malicious link or visit the crafted URL for the attack to succeed.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). The impact is on the same component (the plugin/page). No privilege escalation to other components or systems.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Reflected XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim user (e.g., cookies, tokens). This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Reflected XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts in the context of the victim, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of the user. This is generally considered a **Low** impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Reflected XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack delivered over the network via crafted URL                                         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Low complexity to craft and deliver the attack                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  | No privileges required by attacker                                                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must click the malicious link                                                      |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to the vulnerable component                                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible disclosure of sensitive info                                                    |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible modification of data or actions on behalf of user                                |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability                                                                 |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.4

#####704#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in savignano S/Notify before 4.0.2 for Confluence.
- The configuration settings can be modified via a CSRF attack.
- The attack requires an administrative user to be logged in.
- The attacker tricks the admin into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
- The impact is modification of configuration, potentially leading to loss of email encryption.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is initiated remotely by tricking the admin into clicking a link or visiting a website.
- This implies the attacker can be anywhere on the network (Internet).
- Therefore, **AV = Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack requires the admin to be logged in and to click a malicious link or visit a malicious website.
- This is a social engineering step but does not require special conditions beyond that.
- CSRF attacks are generally considered low complexity if the user is logged in.
- Therefore, **AC = Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker does not have any privileges initially.
- The attack requires the victim (admin) to be logged in, but the attacker does not need privileges on the system.
- Therefore, **PR = None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires the admin to click a malicious link or visit a malicious website.
- This is user interaction.
- Therefore, **UI = Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows modification of the S/Notify app configuration.
- The impact is limited to the same security scope (the Confluence application).
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Therefore, **S = Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The impact is that email notifications may no longer be encrypted.
- This implies potential loss of confidentiality of email content.
- The description says "email notifications being no longer encrypted when they should be."
- This is a **Low** confidentiality impact (some information could be exposed).
- Therefore, **C = Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can modify configuration settings.
- This is a modification of data/configuration, so integrity is impacted.
- The impact is likely limited to the configuration of the app, not the entire system.
- Therefore, **I = Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**

- There is no mention of availability impact.
- Therefore, **A = None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via web |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, only user interaction needed |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | Requires admin to click link or visit site |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same security scope |
| C      | L     | Potential loss of confidentiality (unencrypted emails) |
| I      | L     | Configuration modification impacts integrity |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836 (approx)

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515 (approx)

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.515 + 2.836)  
= Roundup (5.351)  
= 5.4

#####705#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A Cross-Frame Scripting vulnerability in Plone CMS versions below 6.0.5. An attacker could store a malicious URL to be opened by an administrator and execute a malicious iframe element.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker stores a malicious URL that will be opened by an administrator.  
- The attack likely requires the attacker to submit or store the malicious URL remotely, which is then accessed by the admin.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network (e.g., via web interface).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to store a malicious URL that an administrator will open.  
- This requires some user action (admin opening the URL), but the attacker does not need special conditions beyond that.  
- No special environment or timing conditions are mentioned.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker stores a malicious URL that will be opened by an administrator.  
- The description does not specify that the attacker needs any privileges on the system to store the URL.  
- Usually, in CMS, storing content might require at least some user privileges, but since it's not specified, assume the attacker can do this without privileges (e.g., via a public input).  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The administrator must open the malicious URL for the attack to succeed.  
- This is explicit in the description.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of a malicious iframe element in the administrator's context.  
- This likely affects the same security scope (the CMS application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can execute a malicious iframe, which could lead to data disclosure or session hijacking.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but iframe injection can lead to some confidentiality impact.  
- Assume Low (L) because the attacker can potentially access some confidential information via the iframe.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute malicious content in the administrator's browser, potentially modifying data or settings.  
- This suggests some integrity impact.  
- Assume Low (L) because the attacker can influence the administrator's actions or data.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)

#####706#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in GTKWave 3.3.115.
- Triggered by opening a specially crafted .vzt file.
- Leads to memory corruption.
- Victim must open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious file.  
- The attacker must deliver a file to the victim, who then opens it locally.  
- This implies the attack requires local access to the victim's machine (e.g., user opening a file).  
- Therefore, **AV:L (Local)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted file.  
- No indication of environmental or timing conditions or other complexities.  
- Crafting the file is straightforward (integer overflow in parsing).  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The victim must open the file; no mention of needing elevated privileges.  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the victim system.  
- Therefore, **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- Therefore, **UI:R (Required)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to memory corruption within the GTKWave application.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data leakage, but memory corruption often can lead to some data exposure.  
- Given the uncertainty, assign **C:L (Low)** to reflect possible limited confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can allow modification of data or code execution.  
- This suggests at least a low impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, **I:L (Low)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Therefore, **A:L (Low)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 × 0.526  
≈ 3.38

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.21)  
= 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####707#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Trend Micro Mobile Security (Enterprise) could allow an exploit against an authenticated victim that visits a malicious link provided by an attacker.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by the victim visiting a malicious link, which is typically over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Reflected XSS usually requires the attacker to craft a malicious link, but no special conditions or environment are needed beyond the victim clicking the link. This is considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "an authenticated victim," meaning the victim must be logged in (have some privileges). For CVSS, "authenticated" usually corresponds to Low privileges (L), since the attacker does not need high privileges.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must visit a malicious link, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Reflected XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is usually considered Low impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user, which impacts integrity at a Low level.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.05, 10))  
= round_up(4.56) = 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

#####708#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Multiple integer underflow vulnerabilities in GTKWave 3.3.115.
- Triggered by opening a specially crafted .lxt2 file.
- Leads to memory corruption.
- Victim must open a malicious file to trigger.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious file.  
- The attacker must deliver a file to the victim, who then opens it locally.  
- This implies the attack is local (L) because the attacker cannot exploit remotely without user action.  
- However, if the file can be delivered over the network (e.g., via email or download), but the actual exploit requires the victim to open the file, the vector is usually considered Local (L).  
- **AV:L**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file, but no special conditions or environment are required beyond opening the file.  
- This is a straightforward attack once the file is crafted.  
- **AC:L**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The victim only needs to open the file; no privileges beyond normal user rights are needed.  
- **PR:N**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- **UI:R**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to memory corruption within the GTKWave application.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes privileges outside the scope of the application.  
- Therefore, scope is unchanged.  
- **S:U**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
- Integer underflow leading to memory corruption can sometimes allow reading sensitive data.  
- Given the uncertainty, assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality impact.  
- **C:L**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can allow modification of data or code execution.  
- This suggests at least a low impact on integrity.  
- **I:L**

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Assign low impact for availability.  
- **A:L**

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

#####709#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An unchecked return value in TLS handshake code could have caused a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The issue is an unchecked return value in TLS handshake code.
- This could cause a crash that is potentially exploitable.
- The vulnerability affects client software (Firefox, Thunderbird).
- The crash occurs during TLS handshake, which is a network operation.
- The description does not mention any user interaction or privilege requirements explicitly.
- The impact is a crash, which affects availability primarily.
- No mention of confidentiality or integrity impact.
- The vulnerability is in client software, so the attacker likely needs to connect to the client (network vector).
- The scope is likely unchanged because the crash affects the same security scope (the application).

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in TLS handshake code, which is triggered over the network.  
- So, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is an unchecked return value causing a crash.  
- No special conditions or complex steps are mentioned.  
- So, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges on the victim machine to trigger the crash.  
- The attacker just needs to connect to the client.  
- So, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is in the TLS handshake, which is automatic when connecting to a server.  
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.  
- So, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The crash affects the application itself, no indication that it affects other components or security domains.  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- So, C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
- So, I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash, which impacts availability.  
- The crash is potentially exploitable, so the impact is likely High.  
- So, A = High (H)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6 * 0.56 = 3.36

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.36 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(7.27) = 7.3

#####710#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in /upgrade/control.php of ZenTao Community Edition v18.10, ZenTao Biz v8.10, and ZenTao Max v4.10 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted .txt file.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited by uploading a crafted file, which typically requires network access to the web application.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to upload a crafted .txt file to trigger arbitrary code execution.  
- No special conditions or timing are mentioned, so complexity is low.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Usually, file upload vulnerabilities in web apps can be exploited by unauthenticated users unless stated otherwise.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker uploads the file directly; no user interaction is required.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution on the affected component (web application).  
- Usually, arbitrary code execution in a web app affects the same security scope (the web app).  
- However, if the code execution leads to control over the underlying system or other components, scope might be changed.  
- Since the description says "execute arbitrary code," it likely means code execution on the server, which changes the scope from the web app to the underlying system.  
- Therefore, S = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- So, Confidentiality impact is High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution allows full modification of data and system files.  
- Integrity impact is High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can disrupt or deny service.  
- Availability impact is High (H)

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to upload the file                                                 |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                                              |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Arbitrary code execution changes scope beyond the vulnerable component                     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Full disclosure possible due to code execution                                            |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Full modification possible                                                                |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####711#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's HID subsystem (usbhid).
- An info leak occurs due to incorrect calculation of report length when report->size is zero.
- This causes a large buffer length (16384 bytes) to be passed, leading to an information leak.
- The issue is fixed by correcting the length calculation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's USB HID driver.  
- Exploitation requires sending a crafted USB control request (urb) to the device.  
- USB devices are connected locally or via USB hubs, which are considered **Adjacent (A)** in CVSS terms (not Network, since USB is not a network interface).  
- Therefore, AV = **A**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue arises from a specific condition: report->size being zero, which is not typical.  
- However, the attacker can trigger this by sending a crafted USB control request.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond sending crafted input.  
- AC = **Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To send USB control requests to a device, the attacker typically needs to have user-level access to the system to interact with USB devices.  
- However, in many systems, unprivileged users can interact with USB devices (e.g., via /dev/bus/usb or similar interfaces).  
- Assuming the attacker is a local unprivileged user who can send USB requests, PR = **None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted USB requests.  
- No user interaction is required from other users.  
- UI = **None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes an information leak within the kernel memory.  
- The impact is confined to the kernel's memory space; it does not affect other components or security domains.  
- The scope is **Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes an information leak of 16384 bytes of kernel memory.  
- This is a significant leak of sensitive information.  
- The leak is partial but substantial.  
- C = **Low (L)** (not High because it is a leak, not full disclosure)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data.  
- I = **None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
- A = **None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | USB device is Adjacent |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to send USB requests |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact confined to kernel memory |
| C      | L     | Partial info leak of kernel memory |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.5565  
≈ 8.22 × 0.345  
≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U),  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact Subscore + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(4.25)  
= 4.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An Improper Authentication vulnerability in Korenix JetNet TFTP allows abuse of this service. This issue affects JetNet devices older than firmware version 2024/01."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Improper Authentication  
- **Component:** TFTP service on Korenix JetNet devices  
- **Impact:** Allows abuse of the service (likely unauthorized access or actions)  
- **Affected devices:** Older firmware versions (before 2024/01)  

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS base metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a TFTP service, which is a network protocol.  
- TFTP typically operates over UDP and is accessible over the network.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Improper Authentication usually means no complex conditions are required to exploit.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or environment constraints.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since it is an authentication bypass, the attacker likely does not need any privileges beforehand.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker abuses the service directly; no user interaction is mentioned or implied.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the TFTP service on the device.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., other components or the OS).  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Improper Authentication can allow unauthorized access to data or information.  
- The description says "allows abuse of this service," which implies some confidentiality impact.  
- Since the exact impact is not detailed, but abuse of the service usually implies at least some data exposure, assign **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Abuse of the service could allow modification of data or configuration.  
- Since it is an authentication bypass, the attacker might be able to modify data or settings.  
- Assign **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Abuse of the service could lead to denial of service or disruption.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention availability impact.  
- To be conservative, assign **None (N)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
SQL Injection vulnerability in Dzzoffice version 2.01, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the doobj and doevent parameters in the Network Disk backend module.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection typically requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote attackers" with no mention of needing any privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that the attacker needs a user to perform any action. The attacker can send requests directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows obtaining sensitive information from the backend module. No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  The impact is on confidentiality only, and no indication that the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can obtain sensitive information. This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
  Since the attacker can obtain sensitive information, but no indication of full system compromise, this is likely Low or High.  
  SQL Injection can often lead to full data disclosure, but the description only says "obtain sensitive information," which suggests a significant impact.  
  Given the wording, let's assign **High (H)** for confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modifying data or integrity impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attacker |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | H     | Sensitive information disclosure |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.595 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.475)  
= 7.5

#####714#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: StrangeBee TheHive versions 5.1.0 to 5.1.9 and 5.2.0 to 5.2.8
- Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in case attachment functionality
- Attack vector: Attacker uploads a malicious HTML file with JavaScript, executed in the context of the application via a specific URL.
- Impact: Can coerce a victim account to perform actions, potentially escalating privileges to administrator.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by uploading a malicious file and then tricking a victim to visit a URL that executes the script.  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access; the attack is performed over the network (web application).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must upload a malicious file and then coerce a victim to visit a specific URL.  
- This requires some user interaction but no special conditions or environment complexity.  
- The complexity is not high because the attacker can upload the file and the victim just needs to open a URL.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker uploads a malicious file, presumably without any privileges (since it is an attachment upload).  
- The victim is coerced to perform actions, but the attacker does not need privileges to initiate the attack.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must be coerced to visit a specific URL to trigger the XSS.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to perform actions as the victim, potentially escalating privileges to administrator within the same application.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (TheHive application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can execute JavaScript in the victim's context, potentially accessing sensitive information available to the victim.  
- This is at least a Low impact on confidentiality.  
- Given the ability to coerce actions and possibly escalate privileges, confidentiality impact could be High.  
- However, the description focuses on coercion and privilege escalation rather than direct data exfiltration.  
- Conservative choice: Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can coerce the victim to perform actions, including privilege escalation to administrator.  
- This implies a High impact on integrity (attacker can modify data or state).  
- I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- A = None (N)

---

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

### Optional: Calculate Base Score (for completeness)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

Calculate Impact:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.3432  
= 0.6568

Impact Sub-Score (Scope Unchanged):

Impact = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.6568  
= 4.2176

Exploitability:

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.274  
= approx 2.25

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.2176 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(6.4676)  
= 6.5

---

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.5 (Medium severity)**

---

**Final output:**

AV: Network (N)  
AC: Low (L)  
PR: None (N)  
UI: Required (R)  
S: Unchanged (U)  
C: Low (L)  
I: High (H)  
A: None (N)

#####715#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affects: CodeAstro Simple Banking System 1.0, specifically createuser.php (Create a User Page)
- Attack Vector: Possible to initiate the attack remotely
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- Impact: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to initiate the attack remotely"  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of any special conditions or complexity to exploit.  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if no special conditions are mentioned.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the "Create a User Page" (createuser.php), but the description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Since the attack can be initiated remotely and no privileges are mentioned, assume no privileges required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS usually requires a victim user to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a page).  
- The description does not explicitly say the attack is self-contained or automatic.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (createuser.php) and does not mention any impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information (e.g., cookies, session tokens) but usually limited to low impact unless explicitly stated.  
- Since the description is generic and does not mention high confidentiality impact, assign Low.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that may modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically considered a Low impact on integrity unless the description states otherwise.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack can be initiated remotely over the network                                         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions or complexity mentioned                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to exploit                                                         |
| User Interaction (UI) | R     | User interaction required for XSS to succeed                                              |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible information disclosure, but limited impact                                       |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of data or actions via script injection                              |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability mentioned                                                       |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####717#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Solar-Log Base 15 Firmware 6.0.1 Build 161 (and possibly others).
- Stored XSS vulnerability in the web portal (switch group function).
- Allows an attacker to escalate privileges from a lower role to installer or PM.
- From there, attacker can gain administrative access and execute further attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in a web portal, accessible via a URL path.
- Exploitation likely occurs remotely over the network.
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- Stored XSS vulnerabilities typically require the attacker to inject malicious script that is later executed by a victim.
- However, the description implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly to escalate privileges.
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker exploits a stored XSS to escalate privileges.
- The attacker must have some initial access to the web portal to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., to inject the stored XSS payload).
- The description does not explicitly say the attacker is unauthenticated.
- However, since the attacker escalates privileges from a lower role to installer or PM, the attacker likely needs to be authenticated with some privileges.
- So, **Privileges Required:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**

- Stored XSS requires a victim to load the malicious script for the attack to succeed.
- The attacker escalates privileges by exploiting stored XSS, which implies that a user (likely the victim) must interact with the malicious payload.
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**

- The attacker escalates privileges from a lower role to installer or PM, then to admin.
- This indicates the vulnerability affects resources beyond the initial security scope.
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation and affects the security scope.
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker gains administrative access, which implies full access to confidential information.
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can escalate privileges and execute further attacks, implying they can modify data.
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**

- No explicit mention of availability impact.
- The attacker gains admin rights but no mention of denial of service or disruption.
- **Value:** None (N)

  The attacker is remote and accesses the SSH service over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker uses a hidden hard-coded account to authenticate. This implies no special conditions or environment requirements beyond knowing the account.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and authenticates directly with root privileges, so no privileges are required before the attack.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker authenticates directly; no user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows the attacker to gain root privileges on the SSH service, which is part of the same security scope (the system). No indication that the scope changes beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Gaining root access allows full access to confidential information.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Root access allows full modification of system data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Root access allows the attacker to disrupt or deny service.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

**CVE Description:**  
"When access to the 'admin' folder is not protected by some external authorization mechanisms e.g. Apache Basic Auth, it is possible for any user to download protected information like exam answers."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows "any user" to download information if no external authorization is in place. This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack requires no special conditions other than the absence of external authorization. This is straightforward and does not require complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is "any user," implying no privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**

  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to protected information within the same security scope (the "admin" folder on the same system). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can download protected information (exam answers), which is a clear confidentiality impact. The impact is significant but not total system compromise.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  There is no indication that the attacker can modify data, only read it.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  There is no indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.475 ≈ 3.90

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.90, 10))  
= round_up(7.49)  
= 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS.
- DTLS servers allow remote attackers to reuse the same epoch number within two times the TCP maximum segment lifetime, violating RFC6347.
- This allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive application data of connected clients.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable by remote attackers.  
- Since DTLS is a network protocol, the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must reuse the same epoch number within a specific time window (two times the TCP maximum segment lifetime).  
- This requires some timing and protocol knowledge but no special conditions beyond that.  
- The complexity is not trivial but also not very high.  
- Usually, timing constraints increase complexity, but since the attacker is remote and can reuse epoch numbers, this is likely **Low (L)** complexity.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and can exploit without any privileges on the system.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely without requiring user interaction.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to sensitive application data of connected clients.  
- The impact is on the same security authority (the DTLS server and its clients).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Scope = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can obtain sensitive application data.  
- This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
- Since the attacker obtains sensitive data, but the description does not specify total data disclosure, this is likely **Low (L)** or **High (H)**.  
- Given "sensitive application data" and no mention of full disclosure, **Low (L)** is appropriate.  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
- **I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | L     | Sensitive data disclosure |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**

= 1 - [0.78 * 1 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Path traversal via manipulation of the argument `download_file` in `download.php`.
- Impact: Allows access to files outside the intended directory.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Affects: Employee Profile Management System 1.0.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating a web parameter (`download_file`), which suggests remote exploitation over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Path traversal vulnerabilities typically require no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request.  
- No mention of additional conditions or timing constraints.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any authentication or privileges.  
- The attacker likely does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request; no user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to files outside the intended directory, but it does not mention affecting resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Path traversal typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application).  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Path traversal can lead to unauthorized disclosure of files, which impacts confidentiality.  
- The impact is likely more than none but may not be total disclosure of all data.  
- Given the ability to read arbitrary files, this is likely High (H) or Low (L).  
- Since the description implies arbitrary file access, **High (H)** is appropriate.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Path traversal typically allows reading files, not modifying them.  
- No mention of modification or data tampering.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 3.89, 10)) = round_up(7.49) = 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue fixed in AIT-Deutschland Alpha Innotec Heatpumps V2.88.3 or later, V3.89.0 or later, V4.81.3 or later and Novelan Heatpumps V2.88.3 or later, V3.89.0 or later, V4.81.3 or later, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the password component in the shadow file."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows **remote attackers** to execute arbitrary code. This implies the attack can be performed over a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; arbitrary code execution via a password component in a shadow file suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code," implying no privileges are required to exploit.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required; the attacker can execute code remotely without user involvement.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable software). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)

- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
  = 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
  Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
  = round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
  = round_up(9.77) = 9.8

#####724#####
Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WP Job Portal.

**Step 1: Understand the vulnerability**

- **Type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Affected product:** WP Job Portal – A Complete Job Board, versions up to 2.0.6
- **Description:** CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs some action without their consent.

**Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric**

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically executed over the network since the attacker lures the victim to visit a malicious website or click a crafted link. The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page). However, no special conditions or complicated steps are needed beyond social engineering. This is considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system; however, the victim must be authenticated (have privileges). The attacker exploits the victim's privileges. According to CVSS v3.1, if the attacker does not need privileges themselves, PR is None.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). There is no impact on other components or security domains.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions, but typically does not directly disclose confidential information. However, depending on the action, it might lead to some data exposure. Since the description does not specify data disclosure, we assume no confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF attacks can modify data or perform unauthorized actions, impacting integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF typically does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

**Step 3: Summary of metric values**

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

**Step 4: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score**

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(4.09) = 4.1

**Severity:** Medium (4.0 - 6.9)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.6.8. do_vcc_ioctl in net/atm/ioctl.c has a use-after-free because of a vcc_recvmsg race condition."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Component:** Linux kernel, specifically a function in net/atm/ioctl.c
- **Type:** Use-after-free due to a race condition
- **Impact:** Likely memory corruption, potentially leading to privilege escalation, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.
- **Access Vector:** Since this is a kernel ioctl interface, it is typically accessible locally (via a local user or process).
- **Privileges Required:** Usually, ioctl calls require some level of privileges or at least local access.
- **User Interaction:** Not required, as this is a direct system call interface.
- **Scope:** The vulnerability is in the kernel, so if exploited, it can affect the kernel's integrity and availability, possibly changing scope.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Use-after-free can lead to arbitrary code execution or system crash, so likely high impact on integrity and availability, confidentiality impact is less clear but could be low or none.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploited via an ioctl call in the kernel. This requires local access to the system.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The issue is a race condition, which generally increases complexity because timing must be precise.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  ioctl calls often require at least some privileges. However, some ioctl interfaces are accessible to unprivileged users. Since the description does not specify, but it's a kernel ioctl, assume low privileges required (e.g., unprivileged user can open the device).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No user interaction is needed; the attacker can trigger the ioctl directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the kernel, and exploitation can affect kernel memory and behavior, potentially impacting other components beyond the vulnerable function. This suggests scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact. Assume Low (L) to be conservative.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Use-after-free can lead to arbitrary code execution or modification of kernel memory, so High (H).  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Use-after-free can cause system crashes or denial of service. High impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:H = 0.44
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:L = 0.22
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 1.37

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.151 = 0.849

Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.849 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.849 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.82 - 3.25 * (0.829)^15  
= 6.17 - 3.25 * 0.072  
= 6.17 - 0.234 = 5.94

**Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (5.94 + 1.37), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 7.31, 10))  
= round_up(7.89) = 7.9

#####726#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1 contains a stack overflow via the iptv.stb.mode parameter in the function formSetIptv.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type:** Stack overflow (memory corruption)  
- **Parameter:** iptv.stb.mode (likely a web parameter)  
- **Function:** formSetIptv (likely a web form handler)  
- **Device:** Tenda AX1803 router firmware v1.0.0.1

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   Since the vulnerability is triggered via a parameter (likely HTTP request parameter), the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
   **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   Stack overflow via a parameter usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request. No mention of special conditions or timing.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   The parameter is likely accessible without authentication (common for web parameters in routers, especially if no mention of authentication). Assume no privileges required.  
   **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   The attacker sends the crafted request directly; no user interaction needed.  
   **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   Stack overflow in a router's web interface likely affects the same security scope (the router's firmware). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
   **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   Stack overflow can lead to code execution or crash. If code execution is possible, confidentiality can be high. However, the description only mentions stack overflow, no explicit info on data disclosure.  
   Assume **Low (L)** because some data might be exposed or attacker can read some memory.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   Stack overflow can allow code execution or modification of data.  
   Assume **High (H)** because integrity can be fully compromised.

8. **Availability (A):**  
   Stack overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
   Assume **High (H)** because availability can be fully compromised.

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via parameter |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |

| A      | H     | Possible full availability compromise |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.151  
= 0.849

- Impact (S:U) = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.849  
= 5.45

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.474  
= 3.90

- Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.90, 10))  
= round_up(9.35)  
= 9.4

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H**

#####727#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Incorrect default permissions in some Intel Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) driver for Windows 10 for Intel NUC P14E Laptop Element software installers before version 5.4.1.4479 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires local access ("via local access"). So, the attacker must be on the system.  
  **AV = Local (L)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; it is about incorrect default permissions, which is generally straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "may allow an authenticated user" to escalate privileges. This means the attacker must already have some privileges (authenticated user), but not necessarily high privileges. Usually, "authenticated user" implies Low privileges.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  There is no mention of requiring user interaction (e.g., clicking a link, opening a file). The attacker is local and can exploit the permissions directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, meaning the impact crosses from one security scope to another (e.g., from user to system). This changes the scope.  
  **S = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description focuses on privilege escalation, which may allow access to sensitive information. Since it is privilege escalation, confidentiality impact is likely Low or High. However, the description does not specify data disclosure, only privilege escalation. Usually, privilege escalation implies at least Low confidentiality impact.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Privilege escalation typically allows modification of system files or settings, so integrity impact is at least Low.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.49

**Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 7.52 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0, else:  
Since Scope is Changed:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (2.95 + 2.49), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 5.44, 10))  
= round_up(5.88) = 5.9

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Skyworth Router CM5100, version 4.1.1.24.
- Insufficient validation of user-supplied input for a URL parameter in the web interface.
- Remote attacker can supply specially crafted input to the web interface parameter.
- Successful exploitation allows stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker exploits the web interface remotely.  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, which is typically straightforward to exploit.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and supplies input to the web interface parameter.  
- Usually, web interface input parameters are accessible without authentication unless stated otherwise.  
- No mention of needing credentials.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Stored XSS requires a victim user to visit the page containing the malicious script for the attack to have effect.  
- The attacker stores the malicious script, but the impact depends on a user viewing the page.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the web interface of the router.  
- The impact is on the same component (the web interface/system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users.  
- This results in a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS allows an attacker to execute scripts in the context of the victim, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- No indication of denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- **A:N (None)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via admin settings.
- Affected software: Complianz – GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent plugin for WordPress, versions ≤ 6.5.5.
- Attack vector: Injection of scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.
- Attacker: Authenticated attackers with administrator-level permissions and above.
- Conditions: Only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html is disabled.
- Impact: Injection of arbitrary web scripts, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the payload.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with admin privileges and inject scripts via admin settings.
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface (admin panel).
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.
- The attack is performed over the network (HTTP requests to admin panel).
  
**Value:** Network (N)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must have admin-level permissions.
- The vulnerability requires specific conditions: multi-site installations and unfiltered_html disabled.
- However, once these conditions are met, the attack is straightforward (injecting scripts via admin settings).
- No special timing or environment conditions beyond the stated ones.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level permissions or above.
- Administrator-level permissions are considered High privileges in WordPress context.

**Value:** High (H)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The injected script executes when a user accesses the injected page.
- The attacker cannot trigger the script execution themselves; it requires a user to visit the page.
- Therefore, user interaction is required for the impact to occur.

**Value:** Required (R)

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the plugin running within WordPress.
- The impact is limited to the plugin and WordPress environment.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.

= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.22, 10))  
= round_up(3.63)  
= 3.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in HYPR Workforce Access on Windows allows Overflow Buffers. This issue affects Workforce Access: before 8.7."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds.
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
- The product is HYPR Workforce Access on Windows.
- No explicit mention of required privileges or user interaction.
- The vulnerability affects versions before 8.7.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in network-facing applications are often exploitable remotely.  
- Since this is Workforce Access (likely a network service), assume the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities usually have low complexity if no special conditions are required.  
- No mention of special conditions or environment.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Usually, buffer overflow in a network service can be exploited without privileges.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- Buffer overflow in a network service is typically exploitable without user interaction.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- Buffer overflow in an application can lead to code execution or privilege escalation.  
- If the vulnerability allows control beyond the vulnerable component, scope is changed.  
- Workforce Access is an application; if the vulnerability allows code execution beyond the application, scope changes.  
- Usually, buffer overflow in a service leads to changed scope.  
- **S:C (Changed)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to data disclosure or code execution.  
- Since it allows overflow buffers, likely high impact on confidentiality.  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow arbitrary code execution, modifying data.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- **A:H (High)**

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####733#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS (a DTLS implementation).
- Triggered by a malformed ClientHello handshake message with an odd length of cipher suites.
- Results in:
  - Infinite loop causing Denial of Service (DoS) by resource exhaustion.
  - Buffer over-read that can disclose sensitive information.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed by sending a malformed ClientHello handshake message.
- ClientHello is part of the DTLS handshake, which happens over the network.
- Therefore, the attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.

**Value:** Network (N)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker needs to send a malformed ClientHello message with an odd length of cipher suites.
- This is a crafted message but does not require special conditions or timing.
- The description does not mention any special conditions or environment constraints.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is a remote attacker sending handshake messages.
- No privileges are required to send handshake messages.

**Value:** None (N)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends the malformed message directly.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.

**Value:** None (N)

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability causes resource exhaustion and buffer over-read within the same component (tinyDTLS).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or causes impact on other components.
- Therefore, scope is unchanged.

**Value:** Unchanged (U)

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The buffer over-read can disclose sensitive information.
- The description does not specify the amount or sensitivity of the data, but it is non-zero.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Integrity (I):**

- No indication that the attacker can modify data or cause integrity loss.
- The issue is DoS and information disclosure only.

**Value:** None (N)

---

**Availability (A):**

- The infinite loop causes resource exhaustion leading to Denial of Service.
- This impacts availability significantly.

**Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attacker |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | L     | Buffer over-read discloses sensitive info |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Infinite loop causes DoS |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.3432  
= 0.6568

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.6568  
= 4.22

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(8.11)  
= 8.1

#####734#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Shopware's Flow Builder functionality does not adequately validate URLs used in the "call webhook" action.
- This allows malicious users to perform web requests to internal hosts.
- The issue is fixed in certain plugin versions.
- The vulnerability involves sending crafted requests that cause the application to make internal web requests.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability involves sending a crafted URL to the application.
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The description suggests the vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of URLs.
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.
- The attacker only needs to craft a URL.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The description says "malicious users" can exploit this.
- It does not specify that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.
- Since the vulnerability is in the Flow Builder functionality, which might be accessible to authenticated users only, but the description does not clarify.
- However, since it says "malicious users" and not "authenticated users," and the vulnerability allows making requests to internal hosts, it is likely that some level of privilege is required to create or configure the webhook action.
- Usually, creating or configuring webhooks requires at least low privileges (e.g., a user account).
- So PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker crafts the webhook URL.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the webhook is called.
- The description does not mention that a user must perform any action for the exploit to succeed.
- The attacker can trigger the webhook call themselves.
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows making web requests to internal hosts.
- This means the impact crosses from the vulnerable component (Shopware application) to other internal systems.
- This is a change in scope because the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.
- Therefore, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can make requests to internal hosts.
- This could lead to information disclosure if internal hosts respond with sensitive data.
- The description does not explicitly say data is disclosed, but the ability to make requests to internal hosts can lead to information disclosure.
- So, Confidentiality impact is Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can make requests to internal hosts.
- This might allow modifying data on internal hosts if the requests are crafted to do so.
- However, the description does not explicitly mention modification of data.
- The impact on integrity is likely Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.
- Therefore, Availability = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network                                                     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires some privileges to create webhook action                                         |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                                              |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Impact crosses security scope to internal hosts                                           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible information disclosure via internal requests                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification via crafted requests                                                |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact mentioned                                                          |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) — since Scope is Changed, PR:L = 0.62
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 8.22 × 0.274 ≈ 2.25

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 7.52 × [ (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 7.52 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

Since Scope is Changed:

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
Impact' = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)] = 2.95 (as above)

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.95 + 2.25) = Roundup (5.20) = 5.2

But when Scope is Changed, the formula for Base Score is:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (1.08 × 5.20) = Roundup (5.62) = 5.6

#####735#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Directory Traversal vulnerability in Stimulsoft GmbH Stimulsoft Dashboard.JS before v.2024.1.2 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the fileName parameter of the Save function.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely ("remote attacker") and involves sending a crafted payload to a function parameter. This implies the attack can be performed over a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to send a crafted payload. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and no mention of needing any privileges. The attacker likely needs no privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention that a user must perform any action for the exploit to succeed. The attacker sends a crafted payload directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable function or component. However, since the description does not explicitly mention a change in scope (e.g., from one security authority to another), and the vulnerability is within the same software component, we assume scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution typically allows full access to data, so confidentiality impact is high.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so integrity impact is high.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt service or cause denial of service, so availability impact is high.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- The vulnerability is declared critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack can be initiated remotely.
- The vulnerable function is accessible via a web form (`/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set`), which implies network access.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating the `ssid` argument.
- No mention of special conditions or environment required.
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and presumably straightforward.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely.
- No mention that authentication or privileges are required.
- The function is likely accessible without authentication (common for router web interfaces).
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker can send the malicious request directly.
- No mention that a user must perform any action.
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in a function of the router firmware.

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.77)  
= 9.8

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####737#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin for WordPress, versions ≤ 8.3.1
- Attack vector: via widget URL parameters
- Attacker: authenticated attackers with contributor access or higher
- Impact: injection of arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via URL parameters, which implies the attacker can send crafted requests over the network.  
- The attacker is authenticated but the attack is performed remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, which is a straightforward XSS.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor access or higher.  
- Contributor is a low-level privilege in WordPress, but it is not "None".  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges mean basic user privileges, "High" means administrative or equivalent.  
- Contributor access is a low privilege level.  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires a user to visit the injected page for the script to execute.  
- The attacker injects the script, but the victim user must access the page for the payload to run.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the WordPress plugin and its users).  
- The impact is on the same component (plugin/page) and does not affect other components or privileges outside the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality, not complete system compromise.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, which can modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- Therefore, Integrity = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- No indication that availability is impacted.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Round_up (4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####738#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the OpenEXR image parsing library (version 3.2.1 and prior) due to failure in validating the number of scanline samples in a file. This is a memory corruption issue that can be triggered by a specially crafted OpenEXR file.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted OpenEXR file.  
- Typically, image parsing libraries process files that are provided over a network or locally.  
- Since the library is likely used in applications that open files locally or from network sources, but the description does not specify remote exploitation or network service.  
- However, since the vulnerability is in a file parser, and the file can be delivered over a network (e.g., downloaded or received), the most common assumption is **Network (N)** if the application processes files from network sources.  
- If the application only processes local files, it would be Local (L).  
- Given the typical usage of image libraries, and no explicit mention of network service, the safest assumption is **Local (L)** because the attacker must provide a malicious file to the victim to open.  
- **AV = L**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to failure to validate the number of scanline samples.  
- This suggests a straightforward buffer overflow triggered by a malformed file.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious file to the victim application.  
- No indication that the attacker needs any privileges on the system.  
- The attacker is likely an unprivileged user who can get the victim to open a malicious file.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must open or process the malicious OpenEXR file.  
- This requires user action (e.g., opening the file in an application).  
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in a library used by an application.  
- The heap-based buffer overflow could lead to code execution or crash within the same security scope (the application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Heap-based buffer overflow can lead to code execution or information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention information disclosure.  
- However, buffer overflows can sometimes lead to information leaks.  
- Since the description only mentions buffer overflow, assume **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality (some potential for info leak).  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow code execution or modification of data.  
- This implies at least a Low impact on integrity.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- At least Low impact on availability.  
- **A = Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Requires local file to be opened |
| AC     | L     | Simple malformed file triggers overflow |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to supply file |
| UI     | R     | User must open/process file |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible data modification/code execution |
| A      | L     | Possible crash or DoS |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 * 0.526  
≈ 3.38

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.21)  
= 5.2 (Medium severity)

**CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L**

#####739#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Post-authenticated server-side request forgery (SSRF).
- Product: Trend Micro Apex Central 2019 (build < 6481).
- Impact: Allows attacker to interact with internal or local services directly.
- Preconditions: Attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- Authentication: Post-authenticated (attacker must have some level of access).
- Attack vector: The attacker already has code execution on the target system (local).
- User interaction: Not explicitly mentioned, likely none.
- Scope: Not explicitly mentioned, but SSRF typically affects the same security scope unless stated otherwise.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- This implies the attacker is local to the system (not remote network).
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must have code execution already, but the SSRF itself does not require complex conditions.
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing.
- The complexity is low because once code execution is obtained, exploiting SSRF is straightforward.
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code.
- This means the attacker needs some privileges, but not high privileges.
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention of user interaction required.
- The attacker already has code execution.
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows interaction with internal or local services.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.
- Therefore, Scope is Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- SSRF can allow access to internal services, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- The description says "interact with internal or local services directly," which implies some confidentiality impact.
- Since the attacker can interact with internal services, some information disclosure is possible.
- Assign Confidentiality = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- SSRF typically allows interaction but not necessarily modification of internal services.
- However, "interact" could imply some ability to affect integrity.
- Given the attacker can send requests to internal services, there is potential for low integrity impact.
- Assign Integrity = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of availability impact.
- SSRF generally does not cause denial of service.
- Assign Availability = None (N).

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Attacker must have local code execution.                                                   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions; straightforward exploitation once code execution is obtained.       |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires low privileges to execute code.                                                  |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |
| Scope (S)            | U      | No indication of scope change.                                                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible information disclosure via internal service interaction.                          |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible low impact on integrity through interaction with internal services.               |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact mentioned.                                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(4.34)  
= 4.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Post-authenticated SSRF in Trend Micro Apex Central 2019 (build < 6481).
- Impact: Allows attacker to interact with internal or local services directly.
- Preconditions: Attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- Exploitation: Post-authentication, with low-privileged code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker must already have low-privileged code execution on the target system.
- The vulnerability allows interaction with internal/local services from the compromised system.
- Since the attacker must have code execution on the system, the attack vector is **Local (L)** (not Network or Adjacent).
  
**AV = L**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must have low-privileged code execution first, which is a precondition.
- However, once code execution is obtained, exploiting the SSRF is straightforward.
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.
- The complexity is **Low (L)**.

**AC = L**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must have low-privileged code execution on the target system.
- This means the attacker requires **Low (L)** privileges.

**PR = L**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker already has code execution on the system.
- No additional user interaction is required to exploit the SSRF.
- **None (N)**.

**UI = N**

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows interaction with internal or local services.
- The impact is on other components/services beyond the vulnerable component.
- This suggests the **Scope is Changed (C)** because the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.

**S = C**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- SSRF can allow the attacker to interact with internal services, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- The description implies the attacker can access internal/local services, which may lead to information disclosure.
- Since the attacker can interact with internal services, but the extent of data exposure is not fully clear, assign **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**C = L**

---

**Integrity (I):**

- SSRF typically allows interaction with internal services, which may allow modification of data.
- The description does not explicitly mention data modification, but interaction with internal services could lead to some integrity impact.
- Assign **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**I = L**

---

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of availability impact.
- SSRF generally does not cause availability issues unless explicitly stated.
- Assign **None (N)** availability impact.

**A = N**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Requires local code execution on the system. |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions; straightforward exploitation once code execution is obtained. |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges on the system. |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required. |
| S      | C     | Impact affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. |
| C      | L     | Potential information disclosure via internal service interaction. |
| I      | L     | Potential modification of internal service data. |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned. |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))

= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))

= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)

= 7.52 * (1 - 0.6084)

= 7.52 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

Base Score = 1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)

= 1.08 * (2.95 + 2.52) = 1.08 * 5.47 ≈ 5.9

Rounded to one decimal place: **5.9**

#####741#####
Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Doofinder WP & WooCommerce Search.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type

- **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Affected product:** Doofinder WP & WooCommerce Search plugin
- **Versions affected:** up to 2.0.33

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**

   - CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network by tricking a user into submitting a request.
   - The attacker does not need local or physical access.
   - **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**

   - CSRF requires the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious site).
   - However, the attack itself is straightforward and does not require special conditions beyond user interaction.
   - **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**

   - The attacker does not need privileges on the system.
   - However, the victim must be authenticated (have privileges) for the attack to succeed.
   - For CVSS, PR is from the attacker's perspective.
   - The attacker does not need privileges on the target system.
   - **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**

   - CSRF requires the victim to perform some action, such as clicking a link or visiting a malicious page.
   - **Value:** Required (R)

5. **Scope (S):**

   - CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application).
   - The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.
   - **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**

   - CSRF can allow unauthorized actions, but usually does not directly disclose confidential information.
   - Depending on the action, it might allow reading or changing data.
   - Typically, CSRF leads to unauthorized state changes rather than data disclosure.
   - **Value:** None (N) or Low (L)
   - Since the description does not mention data disclosure, assume **None (N)**.

7. **Integrity (I):**

   - CSRF can allow unauthorized modification of data or state.
   - This is the primary impact of CSRF.
   - **Value:** Low (L)

8. **Availability (A):**

   - CSRF usually does not impact availability.
   - **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact (unauthorized changes) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score =**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10)) = round_up(4.09) = 4.1

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered via a parameter (adv.iptv.stballvlans) in a function, likely through network communication (e.g., HTTP request to the router's web interface).  
- Since this is a network device and the parameter is likely accessible remotely or at least from the local network, but usually router web interfaces are accessible over the network.  
- Assume Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stack overflow via a parameter suggests a straightforward input that causes the overflow.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Is authentication required to send this parameter?  
- The description does not specify if authentication is needed.  
- Usually, router web interfaces require authentication to access configuration parameters. However, some vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated access.  
- Since the description does not specify, but the parameter is in a form function, likely requires authentication.  
- Assume Low (L) privileges required (authenticated user but not admin).  
- If no info, conservative approach is Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does the attacker need a user to do something?  
- No user interaction is needed; the attacker can send the crafted parameter directly.  
- None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- Stack overflow in the router firmware could lead to code execution or crash affecting the entire device.  
- Usually, firmware vulnerabilities change scope because they can affect the entire system.  
- Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stack overflow can lead to code execution or crash.  
- Potentially high impact on confidentiality if attacker can execute code or read memory.  
- Assume High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Similarly, code execution or crash can modify system state.  
- High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Stack overflow can cause denial of service (crash).  
- High (H).

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: Low (L)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Changed (C)  
- C: High (H)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: High (H)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact:**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (min (1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 * (6.88 + 2.68) = 1.08 * 9.56 = 10.33 → capped at 10.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in flusity-CMS v.2.33, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the add_menu.php component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by attackers. CSRF attacks typically require the victim to visit a malicious site, but the attacker can be anywhere on the network (internet). So, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks generally require the victim to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page), but the attack itself is straightforward and does not require special conditions beyond user interaction. So, the complexity is **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  CSRF requires the victim to perform an action (e.g., click a link or visit a malicious page). So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code via a web component. Since the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the CMS application), and there is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope, the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data, so **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt service, so **High (H)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote network attacker                         |

| Scope (S)            | U      | Same security scope                             |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Arbitrary code execution leads to full disclosure |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Arbitrary code execution leads to full modification |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Arbitrary code execution leads to full disruption |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(8.72) = 8.7 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

#####744#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
SQL Injection vulnerability in Boostmyshop (boostmyshopagent) module for Prestashop versions 1.1.9 and before, allows remote attackers to escalate privileges and obtain sensitive information via changeOrderCarrier.php, relayPoint.php, and shippingConfirmation.php.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable by "remote attackers" via specific PHP scripts.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically require low complexity if no special conditions are needed.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complex steps.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "allows remote attackers to escalate privileges," implying the attacker starts with no privileges.  
- So, no privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.  
- SQL Injection is typically exploited directly by the attacker.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation and obtaining sensitive information.  
- However, it is within the same component/module (Boostmyshop module).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, scope is likely **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can "obtain sensitive information," which indicates a confidentiality impact.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system compromise.  
- Assign **Low (L)** or **High (H)**?  
- Since it says "obtain sensitive information," but no indication of full data disclosure, **Low (L)** is appropriate.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability allows "escalate privileges," which implies the attacker can modify data or perform unauthorized actions.  
- This suggests at least a low integrity impact.  
- Possibly high if attacker can fully control data.  
- Since it is privilege escalation, likely **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **None (N)**

### Summary of metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote attacker over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Impact within same component |
| C      | L     | Sensitive info disclosure |
| I      | H     | Privilege escalation implies high integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(8.11) = 8.1

#####745#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in NCR Terminal Handler v.1.5.1 leads to a one-click account takeover. This is achieved by exploiting multiple vulnerabilities, including an undisclosed function in the WSDL that has weak security controls and can accept custom content types.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network by tricking a user into submitting a request.  
- The vulnerability involves web services (WSDL), which are accessible over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks require the attacker to trick a user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link).  
- However, the description says "one-click account takeover" and "weak security controls," implying no complex conditions or timing constraints.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit CSRF.  
- The attack is performed by tricking an authenticated user.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- CSRF requires the user to perform an action, such as clicking a link or visiting a malicious page.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to an account takeover, which is a change in the security context.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention a change in scope (e.g., from one component to another).  
- Usually, CSRF affecting the same component means Scope = Unchanged (U).  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Account takeover implies access to confidential information.  
- The attacker can access the victim's account data.  
- C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Account takeover allows the attacker to modify data or perform actions as the user.  
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- A = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: High (H)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

#####746#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"freeglut through 3.4.0 was discovered to contain a memory leak via the menuEntry variable in the glutAddMenuEntry function."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Memory leak
- **Component:** freeglut library, specifically in the glutAddMenuEntry function
- **Impact:** Memory leak typically affects availability (resource exhaustion), but usually does not directly impact confidentiality or integrity.
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a function in a library, the attack likely requires local code execution or local access to call the function.
- **Privileges Required:** Likely none or low, depending on whether the function is accessible to unprivileged users.
- **User Interaction:** Probably none, as this is a programming library function.
- **Scope:** Does the vulnerability affect components beyond the vulnerable component? Probably not.
- **Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: None (memory leak does not expose data)  
  - Integrity: None (no data modification)  
  - Availability: Low (memory leak can degrade availability over time)

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in a library function. To exploit it, an attacker must call the function. This implies local access to the system or application using the library.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Memory leak via a variable in a function is straightforward to trigger if the function is called with crafted input. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  If the function is accessible to unprivileged users, then None (N). If it requires some privileges, then Low (L). Since this is a library function, likely no privileges required to trigger the leak.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker calls the function directly; no user interaction required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same component (freeglut library). No indication that it affects other components or privileges.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Memory leak does not expose confidential information.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No data modification or corruption.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Memory leak can degrade availability over time, but not immediate denial of service.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to call function |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trigger leak |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Low impact on availability due to memory leak |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22 = 1.32

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 2.52, 10))  
= round_up(3.84) = 3.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####747#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Symantec Data Loss Prevention version 14.0.2 and before. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a crafted document to achieve code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to open a crafted document. This implies the attack can be launched over a network (e.g., email, download).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to entice a user to open a crafted document, which is a straightforward action and does not require special conditions beyond user interaction.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker must entice a user to open a crafted document, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to code execution, which typically allows the attacker to execute code with the privileges of the vulnerable component. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  Therefore, **Scope is Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution can lead to disclosure of information. Since the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but code execution usually implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
  We assign **High (H)** because code execution can lead to full confidentiality compromise.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows modification of data, so integrity is highly impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can disrupt availability (e.g., crashing the system).  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | H     |

- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(8.55)  
= 8.6 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

Base Score calculation for Unchanged Scope:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085184  
= 0.914816

Impact Score = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.914816  
= 5.874

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556525  
= 8.22 * 0.473046  
= 3.889

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.874 + 3.889, 10))  
= round_up(9.763)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####751#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Command injection in the ping utility on Buffalo LS210D 1.78-0.03 allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary commands onto the NAS as root.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is remote and uses the ping utility, which is typically accessible over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; command injection is usually straightforward once authenticated.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be authenticated, so some privileges are required. The attacker is authenticated but the exact privilege level is not specified. However, since the attacker can inject commands as root, it implies the attacker has at least some user-level access but not root initially.  
  According to CVSS v3.1, if the attacker is authenticated but not root, this is Low (L) privileges required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is remote and authenticated; no mention of needing another user to interact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows command injection as root on the NAS, which is the same security authority as the vulnerable component (ping utility). No indication that the scope changes beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Command injection as root allows full control, including reading sensitive data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Command injection as root allows full modification of data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Command injection as root can disrupt or disable services or the device.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Authenticated attacker, not root initially |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | H     | Full confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Full integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Full availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(5.88 + 2.68, 10))  
= Roundup(8.56) = 8.6 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####752#####
Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WPClever WPC Product Bundles for WooCommerce.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type

- **Vulnerability type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Affected product:** WPC Product Bundles for WooCommerce (up to version 7.3.1)
- **Impact:** CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs an unwanted action on the web application.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page). No special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.  
  The complexity is generally considered **Low (L)** because the attacker only needs to lure the user to a malicious site.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system; however, the victim must be authenticated (have privileges).  
  For CVSS, this is from the attacker's perspective. The attacker does not need privileges on the system.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF attacks typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF usually does not directly disclose confidential information. It causes unauthorized actions but not data leaks.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF can cause unauthorized changes or actions, which impacts integrity.  
  The impact is typically **Low (L)** because the attacker can cause some unauthorized actions but not full control or complete data modification.

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF generally does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to lure user |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact due to unauthorized actions |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base):**

ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact:**

Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base  
= 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.4124

**Exploitability:**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
Calculate stepwise:  
0.85 * 0.77 = 0.6545  
0.6545 * 0.85 = 0.5563  
0.5563 * 0.62 = 0.344  
8.22 * 0.344 = 2.83

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.4124 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(4.2424)  
= 4.3

#####753#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation.
- The issue is a use-after-free bug related to freeing an endpoint (`ep`) too early.
- The fix delays freeing the endpoint using `call_rcu()` to avoid use-after-free.
- The vulnerability occurs during kernel operations involving locking and dumping SCTP socket state.
- The attack scenario involves kernel internal data structures and locking mechanisms.
- The vulnerability is a memory safety issue (use-after-free) that could lead to potential information disclosure, integrity violation, or availability impact.
- The exploitability requires local access to the kernel (since it involves kernel socket structures and locking).
- No indication that user interaction is required.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (kernel).
- The impact is likely to confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some degree, but probably low or medium because it is a use-after-free in kernel internals, which could cause crashes or information leaks.

---

### Step 1: Attack Vector (AV)

- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel SCTP implementation.
- Exploitation requires interaction with kernel socket structures.
- The attack is not remotely exploitable over the network directly; it requires local access to the system to trigger the kernel code path.
- Therefore, **Attack Vector = Local (L)**.

---

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)

- The vulnerability involves a race condition or use-after-free in kernel locking.
- Exploiting use-after-free bugs in kernel usually requires precise timing and conditions.
- This suggests **High complexity (H)**.

---

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)

- The attacker must have the ability to interact with SCTP sockets and trigger kernel code paths.
- This usually requires at least some privileges on the system (e.g., local user).
- Since SCTP sockets can be accessed by unprivileged users on many systems, but kernel memory corruption usually requires at least low privileges.
- So, **Privileges Required = Low (L)**.

---

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)

- The vulnerability is triggered by kernel code paths, no indication that user interaction (like clicking or opening a file) is required.
- The attacker can trigger it by running code locally.
- So, **User Interaction = None (N)**.

---

### Step 5: Scope (S)

- The vulnerability affects kernel memory and data structures.
- The impact is within the kernel security scope.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the kernel security authority.
- So, **Scope = Unchanged (U)**.

---

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)

- Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure or memory corruption.
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but use-after-free can lead to low confidentiality impact.
- So, **Confidentiality = Low (L)**.

---

### Step 7: Integrity (I)

- Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing modification of kernel data.
- This suggests some integrity impact.
- So, **Integrity = Low (L)**.

---

### Step 8: Availability (A)

- Use-after-free bugs can cause kernel crashes (denial of service).
- So, **Availability = Low (L)**.

---

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Exploitation requires precise timing and conditions (race/use-after-free).                 |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Low privileges needed to interact with SCTP sockets.                                       |

| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects kernel security scope only.                                          |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible information disclosure due to use-after-free.                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible integrity impact due to memory corruption.                                        |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Possible denial of service due to kernel crash.                                            |

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.1279 ≈ 1.05

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 × 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.05 + 3.38)  
= Round_up (4.43)  
= 4.4 (Medium severity)

#####754#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"The number of attempts to bring the Hozard Alarm system (alarmsystemen) v1.0 to a disarmed state is not limited. This could allow an attacker to perform a brute force on the SMS authentication, to bring the alarm system to a disarmed state."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves sending SMS messages to the alarm system to brute force the authentication.  
- SMS is typically sent over a network (cellular network).  
- The attacker does not need physical access or local access.  
- Therefore, **AV = Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires brute forcing SMS authentication, which is possible because attempts are unlimited.  
- No special conditions or timing constraints are mentioned.  
- This suggests the attack complexity is low.  
- Therefore, **AC = Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system; they just send SMS messages.  
- Therefore, **PR = None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends SMS messages to the system; no user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- Therefore, **UI = None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The attack affects the alarm system itself, causing it to be disarmed.  
- There is no indication that the attack impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Scope = Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attack allows disarming the alarm system but does not mention disclosure of information.  
- No confidentiality impact is described.  
- Therefore, **C = None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Disarming the alarm system means the attacker can change the system state from armed to disarmed.  
- This is a modification of the system state, so there is an integrity impact.  
- Since the system can be fully disarmed, this is a high impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, **I = High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The attack does not mention denial of service or impact on availability.  
- Therefore, **A = None (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Impact Sub-Score (ISC):**  
ISC = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact:**  
Impact = 6.42 * ISC  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

**Exploitability:**  
Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
TOTOLINK A3300R V17.0.0cu.557_B20221024 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the pppoePass parameter in the setIpv6Cfg function.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a command injection via a parameter (`pppoePass`) in a function (`setIpv6Cfg`).  
- This suggests the attacker can send crafted input remotely, likely over the network (e.g., via a web interface or network service).  
- Therefore, **AV:N (Network)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Command injection vulnerabilities typically require low complexity if no special conditions are needed.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or prerequisites.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a function that sets IPv6 configuration via a parameter.  
- If the attacker can directly supply the `pppoePass` parameter without authentication, then PR is None.  
- The description does not mention authentication or privileges required.  
- Usually, command injection via a parameter suggests no privileges required unless stated otherwise.  
- Therefore, **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Command injection vulnerabilities typically do not require user interaction if the attacker can send the malicious input directly.  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Command injection usually allows the attacker to execute commands on the underlying system, potentially affecting components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- This usually means the scope is changed.  
- Therefore, **S:C (Changed)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including reading sensitive data.  
- Therefore, **C:H (High)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Command injection allows arbitrary command execution, so integrity is fully compromised.  
- Therefore, **I:H (High)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Command injection can allow the attacker to disrupt or disable the system.  
- Therefore, **A:H (High)**.

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22** (max)  
**Impact (Scope Changed) = 0.56 + 0.56 + 0.56 = 1.68**  
Impact sub-score = 7.52 (max)  
Base Score = 9.8 (Critical)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Discord-Recon is a Discord bot used for automated bug bounty recon and information gathering.
- Vulnerability: Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- An attacker can execute shell commands on the server.
- The attacker does **not** need to have an admin role.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.8.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker can execute commands remotely via the Discord bot.  
- Discord bots operate over the network (Discord servers).  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- The attacker can execute commands without admin privileges, implying low complexity.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does **not** need admin role or any privileges.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker executes commands remotely; no mention of needing another user to do anything.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of shell commands on the server hosting the bot.  
- The impact is on the same component (the server running the bot).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Remote code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Remote code execution allows arbitrary code execution, which can modify data.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Remote code execution can disrupt or disable the service.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Full data disclosure possible                    |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Full data modification possible                  |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Full service disruption possible                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.08

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 4.08, 10))  
= round_up(9.96) = 10.0

#####757#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Employee Management System v1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability via the mailud parameter at /aprocess.php.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a web parameter (`mailud` at `/aprocess.php`), which implies remote exploitation over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL injection vulnerabilities typically require low complexity to exploit if no additional conditions are mentioned. The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges. Usually, SQL injection on a public parameter implies no privileges required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is exploiting a parameter directly; no user interaction is needed for the attack to succeed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  SQL injection typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL injection can lead to data disclosure. Usually, this is considered a High impact on confidentiality because attackers can extract sensitive data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL injection can allow attackers to modify or delete data, so integrity is also highly impacted.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL injection can sometimes be used to delete data or cause denial of service, but unless explicitly stated, availability impact is often considered None or Low. Since no DoS or availability impact is mentioned, we assume None.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.36

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 4.36, 10))  
= round_up(9.54)  
= 9.5

#####758#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Juanpao JPShop up to 1.5.02.
- Affects the API component, specifically the file `/api/controllers/admin/app/AppController.php`.
- The vulnerability is due to manipulation of the argument `app_pic_url` leading to unrestricted upload.
- The attack can be launched remotely.
- The exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Rated as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to manipulation of an argument leading to unrestricted upload.  
- No special conditions or environment needed are mentioned.  
- The exploit is publicly disclosed, suggesting it is straightforward.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in an admin API controller, but the description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- The term "unrestricted upload" suggests no privileges are required.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention that a user must perform any action for the attack to succeed.  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely by manipulating the argument.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the API component, specifically an admin controller.  
- The description does not mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or that privileges or control extend beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Typically, unrestricted upload vulnerabilities affect the same security scope (e.g., the web application).  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability is an unrestricted upload, which primarily affects integrity and availability.  
- No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload can allow an attacker to upload malicious files, potentially modifying or adding unauthorized content.  
- This impacts integrity.  
- The impact is likely high because the attacker can upload arbitrary files.  
- Therefore, Integrity = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Unrestricted upload can also lead to denial of service or resource exhaustion if malicious files are uploaded.  
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but unrestricted upload often can affect availability.  
- Given the critical rating, assume at least Low (L) impact on availability.  
- However, since the description is not explicit, and the main impact is integrity, we can conservatively assign Low (L).  
- Therefore, Availability = Low (L).

#####759#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability: Use-after-free in Linux kernel driver (drivers/amd/pm).
- The bug occurs when a pointer is freed and then later accessed, causing a use-after-free.
- This is a memory corruption issue in kernel code.
- The vulnerability is in kernel code, so exploitation likely requires local access.
- No indication that user interaction is required.
- The impact is on the kernel's power management subsystem.
- Potential impacts: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability could be affected due to kernel memory corruption.
- No indication that the scope changes (the vulnerability affects the same security authority).

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel driver code.  
- Exploitation requires local access to the system (an attacker must run code or commands on the machine).  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The bug is a use-after-free triggered by a specific sequence of function calls and conditions (kzalloc returning NULL).  
- This suggests some complexity but not high complexity; the attacker must trigger a specific condition.  
- However, use-after-free bugs in kernel code often require precise conditions but are generally considered Low complexity if no additional conditions like race conditions are mentioned.  
- Given the description, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker likely needs to have some privileges to execute code or commands that trigger the bug.  
- Usually, local kernel vulnerabilities require at least Low privileges (e.g., a local user).  
- No indication that root privileges are required.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- The attacker triggers the bug by invoking kernel functions, presumably via local code or commands.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel memory, but the description does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security authority.  
- The kernel is the security authority here, so the scope is Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free in kernel memory can lead to information disclosure (reading freed memory).  
- Likely some confidentiality impact, but not total system compromise.  
- Assign Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can allow modification of kernel memory or code execution, affecting integrity.  
- Assign Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause system crashes or denial of service.  
- Assign Low (L).

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger kernel bug |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trigger given conditions |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (local user) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged (kernel security authority) |
| C      | L     | Possible info disclosure |
| I      | L     | Possible integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Possible availability impact (crash) |

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.87

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 1 - 0.474 ≈ 0.526

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 1.87, 10))  
= round_up(5.25) = 5.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####760#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `@urql/next` package.
- Condition: The response must return `html` tags and the web application must be using streamed responses (non-RSC).
- Cause: Improper escaping of html-like characters in the response stream.
- Exploitability: An attacker can exploit this by causing the vulnerable response to be returned.

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web client package (`@urql/next`), which is used in web applications.  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely by sending crafted requests that cause the vulnerable response to be returned.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must ensure the response returns `html` tags and that the app uses streamed responses (non-RSC).  
- This is a specific condition that is not trivial but also not very complex.  
- The requirement to have streamed responses and specific response content increases complexity somewhat.  
- Therefore, **High (H)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system to exploit this; it is a client-side XSS triggered by crafted responses.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS typically requires the victim user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
- Since this is an XSS vulnerability, user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the client-side rendering of the web application.  
- The impact is on the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the user (e.g., cookies, tokens).  
- This is typically a **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, potentially altering data or behavior.  
- This is typically a **Low (L)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

### Calculating the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.197  
≈ 1.62

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.62 + 2.51)  
= Round_up (4.13)  
= 4.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Hecheng Leadshop up to 1.4.20.
- Affected function: unknown function in /web/leadshop.php.
- The vulnerability is due to manipulation of the argument "install" leading to deserialization.
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or environment needed.  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if the attacker can control input.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- The argument "install" is manipulated remotely, suggesting no privileges required.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker can send the payload directly.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- Deserialization often leads to code execution or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention if the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Since the vulnerability is in a web application and the attack is remote, and the impact is critical, it is likely the scope is **Changed (C)** because the vulnerability likely affects components beyond the vulnerable code (e.g., system-level impact).  
- **S:C (Changed)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
- However, deserialization vulnerabilities often allow arbitrary code execution, which can lead to full system compromise, including confidentiality impact.  
- Given the critical rating, assume **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution or deserialization manipulation implies the attacker can modify data or system state.  
- **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Critical vulnerabilities often impact availability (e.g., system crash, denial of service).  
- Deserialization can lead to system compromise or crash.  
- Assume **High (H)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Likely impacts beyond vulnerable component |
| C      | H     | Critical impact on confidentiality |
| I      | H     | Critical impact on integrity |
| A      | H     | Critical impact on availability |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
  = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
  = 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
  = 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

- Base Score (Scope Changed) =  
  If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
  Else score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 * (6.20 + 3.87), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 * 10.07, 10))  
  = round_up(min(10.87, 10))  
  = 10.0

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.99

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

#####763#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"There is an unsafe DLL loading vulnerability in ZTE ZXCLOUD iRAI. Due to the program failed to adequately validate the user's input, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escalate local privileges."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves unsafe DLL loading, which typically requires the attacker to have local access to the system to place or influence the DLL loading process.  
- The description mentions privilege escalation, which usually implies local access.  
- Therefore, **AV = Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to failure to validate user input, which is a straightforward issue.  
- No special conditions or timing required are mentioned.  
- Therefore, **AC = Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability to escalate local privileges.  
- This implies the attacker already has some level of privileges but not high privileges.  
- Usually, privilege escalation vulnerabilities require Low privileges to exploit.  
- Therefore, **PR = Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any need for user interaction.  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly.  
- Therefore, **UI = None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is local privilege escalation within the same component or system.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **S = Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability is about privilege escalation, not about data disclosure.  
- No mention of confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, **C = None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Privilege escalation allows the attacker to modify system or application state.  
- This impacts integrity.  
- Since the attacker can escalate privileges, the impact is likely **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- Therefore, **A = None (N)**.

- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.87, 10))

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.1936]  
= 1 - 0.151  
= 0.849

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.849  
= 5.45

**Base Score:**

= Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup(Min[5.45 + 3.89, 10])  
= Roundup(9.34)  
= 9.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####766#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Affects: PeepSo Community plugin
- Impact: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
- Stored XSS means malicious script is stored on the server and executed in the context of other users' browsers.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
Stored XSS can be exploited remotely by sending crafted input that is stored and later executed in other users' browsers. The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
Stored XSS usually requires the attacker to submit malicious input that is stored and then viewed by another user. This is generally straightforward and does not require special conditions.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker typically does not need any privileges to submit malicious input (e.g., a comment or profile field). The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users or users with minimal privileges. Since the description does not specify the need for authentication, assume none.  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
For stored XSS, the victim must view the page containing the malicious script for the exploit to succeed. This requires user interaction (the victim must load the page).  
- UI: Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
Stored XSS affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). It does not affect other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, resulting in some confidentiality impact. Usually, this is considered Low (L) because it depends on the victim's interaction and the data exposed.  
- C: Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
Stored XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially modifying data or performing unauthorized actions. This is generally considered Low (L) impact on integrity.  
- I: Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
Stored XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- A: None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | Victim must view malicious content |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same scope |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact possible |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact possible |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.52 + 2.68) = Roundup(5.20) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **5.2**.

#####767#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in 10Web AI Assistant WordPress plugin.  
- Missing capability check on the install_plugin AJAX action.  
- Allows **authenticated attackers** with **subscriber-level access and above** to install arbitrary plugins.  
- This can lead to further access to the compromised site.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via an AJAX action, which is a web request.  
- The attacker is authenticated but can perform the attack remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or environment needed.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with subscriber-level access or above.  
- Subscriber is a low-level role in WordPress, but it is not "None".  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges means the attacker has some privileges but not administrative.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is authenticated and performs the action themselves.  
- No other user interaction is required.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows installation of arbitrary plugins, which can lead to further access.  
- This likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (plugin) itself, potentially the entire WordPress site.  
- The scope is changed (C) because the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Installing arbitrary plugins can lead to data disclosure or access to sensitive information.  
- The description mentions "unauthorized modification of data" but also implies further access, which can include data disclosure.  
- Given the potential impact, Confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can install arbitrary plugins, which can modify or add code, change data, etc.  
- This is a High impact on Integrity.  
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Installing arbitrary plugins can also disrupt site availability (e.g., by installing malicious plugins that cause denial of service).  
- This is likely High impact on Availability.  
- A = High (H).

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network via AJAX request.                                   |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploit due to missing capability check.                                 |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires subscriber-level access (low privileges).                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required beyond attacker themselves.                                 |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component (site-wide impact).      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Potential for full data disclosure via arbitrary plugin installation.                     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Arbitrary plugin installation allows full modification of data/code.                     |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Arbitrary plugins can disrupt site availability.                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.274  
  ≈ 2.25

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
  = 1 - 0.085  
  = 0.915

- Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
  = 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
  = 6.66 - 0.46  
  = 6.20

- Base Score = Round up to one decimal place:  
  Since Scope is Changed:  
  Base Score = min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
  = min(1.08 * (6.20 + 2.25), 10)  
  = min(1.08 * 8.45, 10)  
  = min(9.13, 10)  
  = 9.1

#####768#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in DroitThemes Droit Elementor Addons – Widgets, Blocks, Templates Library For Elementor Builder.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically executed over the network by tricking a user into submitting a request. The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., clicking a link or loading a page). This is a common and straightforward attack, so the complexity is low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system; the attack relies on the victim's privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim to interact (e.g., click a link or visit a malicious page).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF usually allows unauthorized actions but does not directly disclose confidential information. However, depending on the action, it might lead to some data exposure. Since the description does not mention data disclosure, assume low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF allows unauthorized commands to be executed, which can modify data or state. This is a direct integrity impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF typically does not affect availability. No indication of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.3432 = 0.6568

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 2.83, 10)) = round_up(7.05) = 7.1

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **7.1** (High severity).

#####769#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The Newsletters WordPress plugin before 4.9.3 does not properly escape user-controlled parameters when they are appended to SQL queries and shell commands, which could enable an administrator to run arbitrary commands on the server.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves user-controlled parameters being appended to SQL queries and shell commands.  
- The attacker must be an administrator (has admin privileges) on the WordPress site, which implies local access to the application interface.  
- Since the attacker is an administrator interacting with the plugin, the attack vector is likely **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)**.  
- However, WordPress plugins are typically accessed over the network (HTTP requests). An administrator can send crafted requests remotely.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to improper escaping of parameters, which is straightforward to exploit once admin access is obtained.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description states "which could enable an administrator to run arbitrary commands."  
- The attacker must be an administrator.  
- Administrator is a high privilege level in WordPress.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is an administrator exploiting the vulnerability directly.  
- No additional user interaction is required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows running arbitrary commands on the server, which is outside the scope of the WordPress application itself.  
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries from the application to the underlying system.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Running arbitrary commands on the server can lead to full data disclosure.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary command execution allows full modification of data and system.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary command execution can disrupt or deny service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:H (0.27 if Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 × 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (minimum [6.88 + 1.23, 10])  
= Roundup (8.11) = 8.1

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (5.3)  
= 5.3

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78) = 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.91, 10)) = round_up(5.32) = 5.3

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely via the web (Network).  
- **Attack Complexity:** Typically low for stored XSS because the attacker just needs to submit malicious input that is stored and later rendered.  
- **Privileges Required:** None, as the attacker only needs to submit input (usually unauthenticated).  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the payload to execute.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (web application).  
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal user data, cookies, etc.)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify content seen by users)  
  - Availability: None (XSS generally does not affect availability)

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####773#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow in Delta Electronics DOPSoft when parsing a specific field in a DPS file.  
- Exploitation: Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file.  
- Impact: Remote code execution (implies high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability).  

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must entice a user to open a malicious file. The attack is not purely remote over the network but requires user action on a local file.  
- Since the attacker must have the user open a file, the attack vector is **Adjacent (A)** or **Local (L)**?  
- Opening a file is a local action, but the attacker can deliver the file remotely (e.g., via email). However, CVSS defines:  
  - Network (N): Exploitable remotely over the network without local access.  
  - Adjacent (A): Requires adjacent network access (e.g., same subnet).  
  - Local (L): Requires local system access or user interaction with local files.  
- Since the attacker must have the user open a file locally, this is **Local (L)**.  
- **AV:L**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must craft a specially crafted DPS file and entice a user to open it.  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond user opening the file.  
- This is a straightforward exploit once the file is opened.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated and does not require any privileges on the system.  
- The attack is performed by the user opening the file.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must open the malicious file.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to remote code execution within the application context.  
- Does the vulnerability allow control beyond the vulnerable component?  
- Usually, buffer overflow in an application leads to code execution within the same security scope (the application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or privileges beyond the application.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Remote code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Remote code execution allows arbitrary code execution, modifying data.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Remote code execution can disrupt or disable the system or application.  
- **A:H (High)**

---

### Summary of Metrics

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)  

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 1.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(7.69) = 7.7

### Final CVSS Vector String

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####774#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The vulnerability is in the WP Fastest Cache WordPress plugin before version 0.9.5.
- It lacks a CSRF check in an AJAX action (`wpfc_save_cdn_integration`).
- It does not sanitize and escape some options available via this action.
- This could allow attackers to make logged-in high privilege users call the action and set a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via an AJAX action, which is typically accessible over the network (HTTP request).  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in high privilege user into performing the action (CSRF).  
- CSRF attacks generally require some user interaction but are not complex to perform.  
- However, the attacker must rely on the victim's interaction, but the complexity of the attack itself is low.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker cannot directly exploit the vulnerability without a logged-in user with high privileges.  
- The attacker does not need privileges themselves but relies on a high privilege user to be logged in and perform the action.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, if the attacker must have the victim with privileges, but the attacker themselves has none, PR is considered None (N).  
- However, since the attacker relies on a high privilege user, PR is Low (L) or High (H)?  
- The attacker does not have privileges, but the victim must have high privileges.  
- CVSS guidance: PR is the privileges the attacker must possess, not the victim.  
- Since the attacker does not need privileges, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must trick the user into performing the action (CSRF).  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (plugin) and does not affect other components or privileges outside the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows setting an XSS payload, which can lead to information disclosure if exploited.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention direct data disclosure.  
- XSS can lead to data theft, but the base metric should reflect the direct impact.  
- Usually, stored XSS is considered to have Low confidentiality impact.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- A = None (N).

---

### Summary of metrics:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

#####775#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in JFinalcms 5.0.0 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the /admin/login username parameter.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via the `/admin/login` username parameter, which is typically accessible over the network (e.g., HTTP request).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution via a parameter usually do not require special conditions or timing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker exploits the username parameter, which is typically accessible without authentication.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attacker usually needs the victim to interact (e.g., click a link or visit a page) to execute the script.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary code, but it is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, which typically affects the same security scope (the web application). It does not escalate privileges beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered Low impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, which affects integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |

#####776#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Rubygems.org users with MFA enabled are normally protected from account takeover even if their email account is compromised. However, a vulnerability in the forgotten password form allows an attacker to bypass MFA and take over the account.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves interacting with the forgotten password form on Rubygems.org, which is a web service accessible over the internet.  
- Therefore, the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to exploit a specific workaround in the forgotten password form to bypass MFA.  
- This suggests some level of complexity, but no indication that it requires special conditions or timing.  
- Since the attacker only needs to use the form in a certain way, and no special environment or conditions are mentioned, the complexity is likely low.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system or account.  
- They only need to interact with the forgotten password form.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is exploiting a form on the website; no indication that the legitimate user needs to do anything for the attack to succeed.  
- The attacker is the one interacting with the system.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to take over a user account by bypassing MFA.  
- The impact is on the user account, which is part of the same security authority (Rubygems.org).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Account takeover implies access to the user's private data and possibly sensitive information.  
- This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Account takeover allows the attacker to modify user data, such as gems, profile info, or other account-related data.  
- This is a high impact on integrity.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability of the service or account.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network via web form |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same security scope |
| C      | H     | Account takeover compromises confidentiality |
| I      | H     | Account takeover compromises integrity |
| A      | N     | No impact on availability |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.1936)  
= 6.42 × 0.8064  
≈ 5.18

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(9.06)  
= 9.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####777#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: OS command injection
- Affects: Several QNAP OS versions
- Exploitation: Allows authenticated administrators to execute commands via a network
- Authentication: Requires authenticated administrators (privileges required)
- Attack vector: Network (commands executed via network)
- Impact: Execution of commands (likely high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability)
- User interaction: Not mentioned, likely none (the attacker is the authenticated admin)
- Scope: Not explicitly stated, but command execution on the system likely affects the same security scope (system itself), so scope is unchanged.

---

### Step 1: Assign values for each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity; command injection via network with authenticated admin is straightforward.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Requires authenticated administrators.  
- Administrator privileges are typically considered High (H) in CVSS v3.1.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required; the attacker is the authenticated admin executing commands.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows command execution on the same system; no indication that it affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Command execution by an admin can lead to full data disclosure.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Command execution allows modification of data and system state.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Command execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., delete files, stop services).  
- **Value:** High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: H (High)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:H (0.27 for Scope Unchanged)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.23

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 1.23, 10))  
= round_up(7.11) = 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

#####778#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue in the cp_bbs_sig function in relic/src/cp/relic_cp_bbs.c of Relic relic-toolkit 0.6.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information and escalate privileges via the cp_bbs_sig function."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is described as "remote," which implies the attack can be performed over a network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity; the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.  
- Assume low complexity.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is described as "remote attacker" who can obtain sensitive information and escalate privileges.  
- Since the attacker is remote and can escalate privileges, it implies no privileges are required initially.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required for the attack.  
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which means the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from user to admin or from one component to another).  
- This indicates a **Changed** scope.  
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can "obtain sensitive information," which implies a high confidentiality impact.  
- C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can "escalate privileges," which implies the ability to modify or control system behavior.  
- This is a high integrity impact.  
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- A = None (N).

#####779#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) version 1.0
- Vector: via /cupseasylive/countrylist.php, description parameter
- Impact: Remote attacker sends a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user, stealing session cookie credentials.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., via a web request).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient encoding of user input, which is a common and straightforward XSS.  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond sending a crafted URL.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends a URL to an authenticated user, meaning the victim must be authenticated.  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must be logged in.  
- For CVSS, PR is about the attacker’s privileges, not the victim’s. The attacker does not need any privileges on the system.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim (authenticated user) to click or visit the specially crafted URL.  
- This means user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows stealing session cookies, which affects the user’s session and potentially the application’s security context.  
- However, the vulnerability is within the same security scope (web application).  
- XSS typically does not change scope because it exploits the same security authority.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session cookie credentials, which is a confidentiality breach.  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact but not full system compromise.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute scripts in the victim’s browser, potentially modifying data or actions on behalf of the user.  
- This implies a high integrity impact.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via URL |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward XSS, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | Attacker needs no privileges |
| UI     | R     | Victim must interact (click URL) |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | H     | Session cookie theft (high confidentiality impact) |
| I      | H     | Script execution can modify data (high integrity impact) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(8.02) = 8.0

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

#####780#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerable component: `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` deserialization.
- Issue: Out-of-bounds memory access due to mismatch in lengths during deserialization.
- Impact: Potential memory corruption via Rust-safe methods.
- Fixed by: Adding length checks and restricting header length modification to unsafe code.
- Affects versions 0.5.0 up to but not including 0.12.0.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a Rust library component used by multiple rust-vmm components.  
- Deserialization issues typically occur when untrusted data is processed.  
- Since this is a library, the attack vector depends on how the library is used. However, rust-vmm components are often used in virtual machine monitors or similar environments where data can come from network or local sources.  
- The description does not explicitly say the attack requires local access or physical access.  
- Given that deserialization is involved, and the data could come from a network source (e.g., VM communication), the most reasonable assumption is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a mismatch in lengths during deserialization, which is a straightforward logic flaw.  
- No special conditions or timing required are mentioned.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a library deserialization function.  
- The attacker likely needs to supply malicious input to the deserialization function.  
- No mention that the attacker needs any privileges on the host system.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by deserialization of crafted data.  
- No mention that a user must perform any action (like clicking a link).  
- The attacker can supply the data directly to the vulnerable component.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes out-of-bounds memory access in the same component.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds memory access can lead to reading memory outside intended bounds.  
- This can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but out-of-bounds reads can lead to **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Out-of-bounds memory access can lead to memory corruption.  
- This can allow modification of data or code.  
- So, **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Out-of-bounds memory access can cause crashes or abort deserialization.  
- This can lead to denial of service.  
- So, **Low (L)** availability impact.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network-based deserialization |
| AC     | L     | Simple logic flaw, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to supply input |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact confined to vulnerable component |
| C      | L     | Possible information disclosure via memory read |
| I      | L     | Possible memory corruption/modification |
| A      | L     | Possible denial of service via crash |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.474  
= 0.526

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.526  
= 3.38

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.38 + 3.88)  
= Round_up (7.26)  
= 7.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in WooCommerce PDF Invoices plugin for WordPress.  
- Missing capability check on a specific action (`theprint_packinglist`).  
- Allows unauthorized data access (export orders with sensitive info).  
- Exploitable by authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above.  
- Affects all versions up to 4.3.0.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated and interact with the plugin via WordPress.  
- The attack is performed over the network (HTTP request to WordPress).  
- Although authentication is required, the vector is still Network because the attacker can exploit remotely over the network.  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with subscriber-level access or higher.  
- Subscriber is a low privilege role in WordPress.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges correspond to roles with limited privileges but not none.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is authenticated and performs the action themselves.  
- No other user interaction is required.  
**Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to data within the same security scope (WordPress plugin).  
- No impact on other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unauthorized access to sensitive order data is possible.  
- This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
- The impact is likely significant but not total system compromise.  
- Assign "High" because sensitive data exposure is significant.  
**Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability allows data export but does not mention modification or tampering.  
- No integrity impact.  
**Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No impact on availability is described.  
**Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Unchanged)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[3.60 + 2.83, 10]) = Roundup(6.43) = 6.4

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

#####782#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM Semeru Runtime versions use weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms, which could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability involves cryptographic algorithms used by the runtime. Typically, cryptographic weaknesses can be exploited remotely if the attacker can intercept or interact with the system over a network. Since the description does not specify local access or physical access, and cryptographic attacks usually happen over a network, **AV:N (Network)** is appropriate.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description states "weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms," which implies the attack does not require special conditions or complex steps beyond exploiting the weak crypto. Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is decrypting sensitive information, which suggests the attacker does not need privileges on the system but can exploit the weakness externally. So, **PR:N (None)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required for the attack. Decrypting information via weak crypto typically does not require user interaction. So, **UI:N (None)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects confidentiality by decrypting information but does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. The scope is likely **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can decrypt highly sensitive information, which is a significant confidentiality impact. This is **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description does not mention any modification or tampering with data, only decryption. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No impact on availability is described. So, **None (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector (remote exploitation) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (decrypt highly sensitive info) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.47) = 7.5

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a crafted script sent to a web component (pages.php).  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Code-projects Cinema Seat Reservation System 1.0 allows SQL Injection via the 'id' parameter at "/Cinema-Reservation/booking.php?id=1."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a web parameter (`id` in a URL). This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection via a URL parameter is typically straightforward if the input is not sanitized. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs to send a request with a crafted parameter; no authentication or privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the request directly; no user interaction is needed for the exploit.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the web application itself (likely the same security authority). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL Injection can allow reading sensitive data from the database. This usually leads to a **High** impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL Injection can allow modification or deletion of data. This is a **High** impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL Injection can also be used to delete data or cause denial of service by locking tables or crashing the database. This is typically considered a **High** impact on availability.  
  **Value:** High (H)

#####785#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Aria Operations for Networks contains a cross site scripting vulnerability. A malicious actor with admin privileges may be able to inject malicious code into user profile configurations due to improper input sanitization."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which typically can be exploited remotely over the network (e.g., via a web interface).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. XSS vulnerabilities are generally low complexity if input sanitization is missing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "a malicious actor with admin privileges" can exploit this. So, the attacker must have high privileges.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS usually requires the victim user to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a crafted page or click a link). However, the description does not explicitly mention user interaction. But since the attacker injects code into user profiles, and the impact is on other users, user interaction is typically required for the malicious code to execute in the victim's browser.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects user profile configurations, which likely impacts the same security authority (same scope). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., session tokens, personal data). Since the attacker can inject malicious code that executes in other users' browsers, confidentiality impact is Low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can inject malicious code, potentially modifying data or actions performed by users. This is a Low impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability. No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.62 ≈ 0.90

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 0.90, 10))  
= round_up(3.41) = 3.4

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

#####786#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in a WordPress plugin (simple sort&search) up to version 0.0.3.
- The plugin does not validate the `indexurl` parameter in certain shortcodes.
- This leads to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Exploitable by users with a role as low as Contributor.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by users with Contributor role submitting crafted input (indexurl parameter).  
- Since the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated and interact with the application, the attack vector is **Adjacent (A)** or **Network (N)**?  
- Stored XSS in web apps is typically exploitable over the network (via HTTP requests). However, since the attacker must be a Contributor (authenticated user), the attack is not from an unauthenticated network attacker.  
- The attacker must be logged in and submit data, so the attack vector is **Network (N)** because the attacker can send crafted requests over the network.  
- However, some interpretations consider that the attacker must be authenticated and have a certain role, so the attack vector is still Network (N) because the attack is performed remotely over the network.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to missing validation of URL protocols in parameters.  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond being a Contributor.  
- Attack complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have a Contributor role, which is a low-level authenticated user.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges means the attacker has some privileges but not administrative.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is stored XSS, which means the attacker stores malicious script that is later executed in the victim's browser.  
- The victim must view the stored content for the script to execute.  
- This requires user interaction (the victim must load the page).  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the WordPress plugin and site).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive info.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, potentially changing data or actions performed by the victim.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Attacker must have Contributor role (low privileges).                                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must view the malicious content for XSS to execute.                               |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects the same security scope.                                           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Partial loss of confidentiality due to XSS.                                              |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Partial loss of integrity due to script injection.                                       |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability.                                                               |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.05) = Roundup(4.56) = 4.6 (Medium)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####787#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The EventON WordPress plugin through 4.5.8, EventON WordPress plugin before 2.2.7 do not have authorization in some AJAX actions, allowing unauthenticated users to update virtual events settings, such as meeting URL, moderator, access details etc.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via AJAX actions, which are web requests. This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description suggests no special conditions or complexity; the attacker just needs to send requests to AJAX endpoints without authorization.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is **unauthenticated**, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker can perform the attack directly by sending requests; no user interaction is needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows modification of virtual event settings within the same component (plugin). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., the core WordPress or other components).  
  Therefore, the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can update settings such as meeting URL, moderator, access details. This may expose or modify sensitive information, but the description focuses on modification rather than disclosure.  
  Since the attacker can modify settings, confidentiality impact is at least **Low (L)** (some information may be exposed or changed).  
  However, since the attacker can update access details, this could lead to exposure of confidential information. But the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure.  
  To be conservative, assign **Low (L)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can update virtual event settings, which is a direct modification of data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability (e.g., denial of service).  
  **Value:** None (N)

- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(8.10)  
= 8.1 → 8.1 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required (victim must trigger the payload) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Low confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Low integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.19) = 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS.
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- The attacks perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
- CSRF attacks typically require the victim to interact with a malicious web page, but the attacker can initiate the attack remotely.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- CSRF attacks generally require some conditions, such as the victim being authenticated and visiting a malicious site.  
- This implies some complexity beyond just sending a simple request.  
- AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- CSRF attacks require the victim user to interact (e.g., visit a malicious website).  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary actions on the affected device itself.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention data disclosure.  
- CSRF typically allows actions but not direct data leaks.  
- C = None (N).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary actions imply the attacker can modify or manipulate data or settings.  
- This impacts integrity.  
- Since the description says "arbitrary actions," this suggests a high impact on integrity.  
- I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention denial of service or availability impact.  
- A = None (N).

---

### Summary of Metric Values:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: High (H)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A heap-buffer-overflow was found in SWFTools v0.9.2, in the function swf5lex at lex.swf5.c:1321. It allows an attacker to cause code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in a software tool (SWFTools). Typically, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the software processes untrusted input over a network or locally if the attacker must have local access.  
  Since SWFTools is a command-line tool for processing SWF files, exploitation likely requires the attacker to provide a crafted file to the software. This usually means local or adjacent access, but if the software processes files over a network service, it could be network.  
  Given no explicit network service mentioned, assume **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Heap buffer overflows that lead to code execution usually require precise conditions but are often straightforward once the input is crafted. No mention of special conditions or timing.  
  Assume **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Does the attacker need privileges? Since the attacker must provide a crafted file to the software, and the software runs with the user's privileges, no special privileges are needed.  
  Assume **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Does the attack require user interaction? The attacker must get the victim to run the crafted file or process it. This is user interaction (the victim must open or process the file).  
  Assume **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component? Code execution suggests the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the same security scope (user privileges). No indication of privilege escalation or affecting other components.  
  Assume **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Code execution typically leads to full confidentiality impact.  
  Assume **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Code execution allows full integrity compromise.  
  Assume **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Code execution can disrupt availability.  
  Assume **High (H)**.

#####791#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) WordPress plugin before 9.0.28 does not properly protect most of its REST API routes, which attackers can abuse to store malicious HTML/Javascript on the site.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability is in REST API routes, which are accessible over the network.  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
The description states "does not properly protect most of its REST API routes," implying no special conditions or complexity to exploit.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
Attackers can abuse the API routes to store malicious content. Since the routes are "not properly protected," it suggests no privileges are required to exploit.  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
The attacker abuses the API directly; no user interaction is needed.  
- UI: None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
The vulnerability allows storing malicious HTML/JavaScript on the site, which could affect the site's content and potentially other components beyond the vulnerable component itself. However, the description does not explicitly mention a change in scope (e.g., from one component to another). Usually, injection of malicious content into the site content is considered within the same scope.  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
The description does not mention data disclosure or leakage. The main impact is storing malicious content, not stealing data.  
- C: None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
Storing malicious HTML/JavaScript on the site means the attacker can modify the site's content, which is an integrity impact. Since the attacker can store arbitrary malicious content, this is a high impact on integrity.  
- I: High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
No mention of disruption or denial of service.  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over the network via REST API |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions or complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | H     | Attacker can inject malicious content, high integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.60

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 3.87, 10))  
= round_up(7.47) = 7.5

#####792#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Product: Gradle Enterprise before 2023.1  
- Vulnerability: Non-unique initial system user password on new installations in certain scenarios  
- Impact: A remote attacker may gain access before the legitimate admin changes the password  
- Conditions: The password must be changed on first login, but attacker can log in before that  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and can log in over the network before the admin changes the password.  
- This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must find a new installation with the default password still active.  
- This is a specific condition but not particularly complex; it depends on timing and installation scenario.  
- The attacker does not need special conditions beyond timing.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges to attempt login; they exploit the default password.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker logs in directly; no user interaction is required from any other user.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to the system user account on the same system.  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker gains access to the system user account, which likely allows access to sensitive information.  
- This is more than just a low impact; gaining access to a new installation's system user is significant.  
- However, since this is initial access, and the attacker can log in as the system user, confidentiality is likely **High**.  
- **C:H (High)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- With system user access, the attacker can modify system files or configurations.  
- This implies a high impact on integrity.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker could potentially disrupt the system or deny service by modifying or deleting files.  
- This is likely a high impact on availability.  
- **A:H (High)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(9.76) = 9.8

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.224 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via a crafted HTML page, which implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network (e.g., by convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; type confusion vulnerabilities in V8 are typically straightforward to exploit once discovered.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker needs the victim to visit a crafted HTML page, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the V8 JavaScript engine, which is part of the browser process. Exploiting heap corruption could lead to code execution or compromise beyond the vulnerable component, but typically in Chrome, such vulnerabilities affect the same security scope (browser process). Unless explicitly stated, assume scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact. Given the severity is high, some confidentiality impact is likely.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow an attacker to modify memory, potentially leading to code execution or data modification.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
  **Value:** Low (L) (since the main impact is likely code execution, availability impact is secondary)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.268 ≈ 0.732

**Impact Sub-Score = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.732 ≈ 4.70

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Sub-Score + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.70 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(7.38) = 7.4 → 7.4 rounds to 7.4 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

#####794#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A Time-Based SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in Hospital Management System V4.0 which can allow an attacker to dump database information via a crafted payload entered into the 'Admin Remark' parameter under the 'Contact Us Queries -> Unread Query' tab.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by sending a crafted payload to a parameter in the web application.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Time-Based SQL Injection usually requires the attacker to send crafted payloads and observe timing differences.  
- However, no special conditions or environment requirements are mentioned.  
- Time-based SQLi is generally considered low complexity if no additional conditions are needed.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends a payload to the 'Admin Remark' parameter under 'Contact Us Queries -> Unread Query' tab.  
- The parameter name "Admin Remark" suggests it might be accessible only to authenticated users with admin privileges.  
- However, the description does not explicitly state that authentication or privileges are required.  
- Since the vulnerability allows dumping database information, if the attacker needs to be logged in as admin, PR would be High (H) or Low (L).  
- If no authentication is required, PR is None (N).  
- Given the parameter is under an admin tab, it's likely that some privileges are required.  
- Let's assume **Low (L)** privileges required (e.g., a low-privileged user or authenticated user).  
- If the description had said "unauthenticated," PR would be None. But here, the "Admin Remark" parameter suggests some privilege.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted payload directly to the parameter.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows dumping database information.  
- The impact is on the database, which is likely part of the same security scope as the application.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can dump database information, which is a direct confidentiality impact.  
- This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The description does not mention modifying data, only dumping (reading) data.  
- So, integrity impact is none.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.60 + 2.69) = Round_up (6.29) = 6.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- KernelSU is a kernel-based root solution for Android.
- In versions 0.7.1 and prior, a logic bypass in the kernel module allows any malicious APK named `me.weishu.kernelsu` to gain root permission.
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation to root.
- The attack involves installing a malicious APK with a specific package name.
- No patch available at the time of publication.

---

### Step 1: Attack Vector (AV)
- The attack involves installing a malicious APK on the device.
- Installing an APK typically requires local access to the device (e.g., via USB, or the user downloading/installing the APK).
- The attacker must be able to install an APK on the device.
- This is not a remote network attack, but local.
- **AV = Local (L)**

### Step 2: Attack Complexity (AC)
- The attacker must name the APK exactly `me.weishu.kernelsu`.
- The logic bypass is due to a flaw in the kernel module's checking.
- No special conditions or race conditions mentioned.
- The attack seems straightforward once the attacker can install the APK.
- **AC = Low (L)**

### Step 3: Privileges Required (PR)
- The attacker needs to install an APK.
- Installing an APK on Android usually requires user consent but no prior privileges.
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the device before the attack.
- **PR = None (N)**

### Step 4: User Interaction (UI)
- The user must install the malicious APK.
- This requires user action (installing the APK).
- **UI = Required (R)**

### Step 5: Scope (S)
- The vulnerability allows escalation to root privileges.
- The kernel module is compromised, which affects the system beyond the vulnerable component.
- The scope is changed because the attack impacts system-level privileges.
- **S = Changed (C)**

### Step 6: Confidentiality (C)
- The attacker gains root privileges.
- Root access allows full access to confidential data.
- **C = High (H)**

### Step 7: Integrity (I)
- Root access allows full control over system integrity.
- The attacker can modify any data.
- **I = High (H)**

### Step 8: Availability (A)
- Root access can allow the attacker to disrupt system availability.
- The attacker can delete or modify system files, causing denial of service.
- **A = High (H)**

- AC:L (Low)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:R (Required)
- S:C (Changed)
- C:H (High)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation (for reference):

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula:

- Exploitability sub-score:

  Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI

  Where:

  - AV:L = 0.55
  - AC:L = 0.77
  - PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85
  - UI:R = 0.62

  Exploitability = 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 1.82

- Impact sub-score:

  Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))

  Where:

  - C:H = 0.56
  - I:H = 0.56
  - A:H = 0.56

  Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3) = 7.52 × (1 - 0.44^3) = 7.52 × (1 - 0.085) = 7.52 × 0.915 = 6.88

- Since Scope is Changed:

  Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

  Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 1.82, 10]) = Roundup (8.7) = 8.7

- Final Base Score = 8.7 (High severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Totolink X6000R 9.4.0cu.852_B20230719
- Affects unknown functionality of /etc/shadow
- Leads to hard-coded credentials
- Attack can be launched on the local host
- Attack complexity is high (exploitation is difficult)
- Exploit is publicly disclosed
- Vendor did not respond

---

### Metric Analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack on the local host."  
- This implies the attacker must have local access.  
- **Value:** Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- "The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult."  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not explicitly state if privileges are required.  
- However, since the attack is local and involves /etc/shadow (which is typically protected), and the vulnerability leads to hard-coded credentials, it suggests the attacker may not need prior privileges to exploit it (otherwise it would be mentioned).  
- But since the attack is local, and the vulnerability is in an unknown functionality of /etc/shadow, it is likely that some privileges are required to access or manipulate this file.  
- Given the uncertainty, but considering typical /etc/shadow protections, **Low (L)** privileges required is a reasonable assumption.  
- (If no privileges were required, it would likely be explicitly stated.)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Usually, local attacks on system files do not require user interaction.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects local functionality and credentials.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- "Manipulation leads to hard-coded credentials."  
- This implies a high impact on confidentiality (credentials disclosure).  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Hard-coded credentials can allow unauthorized access and modification.  
- This implies a high impact on integrity.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of impact on availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.31

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[5.18 + 1.31, 10])  
= Roundup(6.49) = 6.5

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

#####797#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An OS command injection vulnerability exists in Akaunting v3.1.3 and earlier. An attacker can manipulate the company locale when installing an app to execute system commands on the hosting server."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker manipulates the company locale during app installation.  
- Installation typically requires network access or local access? Since the attacker can "manipulate" the locale during installation, and installation is often done via a web interface or remotely, this suggests network access.  
- Therefore, **AV:N (Network)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Is the attack straightforward or does it require special conditions?  
- The attacker can manipulate the locale to execute commands, which suggests no special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Does the attacker need any privileges?  
- The attacker can manipulate the locale "when installing an app," which suggests the attacker must have some level of access to the installation process.  
- However, if the installation is done via a web interface accessible without authentication, PR would be None. If authentication is required, PR would be Low or High.  
- The description does not specify authentication or privileges required. Usually, app installation is restricted to admin users.  
- Given the lack of explicit info, but considering typical app installation requires admin privileges, **PR:H (High)** is likely.  
- However, if the attacker can manipulate the locale during installation remotely without authentication, PR:N.  
- Since the description does not specify, but "manipulate the company locale when installing an app" suggests the attacker must have some privileges to install apps.  
- So, **PR:H (High)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does the attack require user interaction?  
- The attacker manipulates the locale during installation, which is an attacker-initiated action, no user interaction needed.  
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- The attacker executes system commands on the hosting server, which is outside the application scope.  
- This indicates a scope change.  
- Therefore, **S:C (Changed)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Does the attack impact confidentiality?  
- OS command execution can lead to data disclosure.  
- Therefore, **C:H (High)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Does the attack impact integrity?  
- OS command execution can modify or delete data.  
- Therefore, **I:H (High)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Does the attack impact availability?  
- OS command execution can disrupt services or delete files, causing denial of service.  
- Therefore, **A:H (High)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network access to manipulate locale during installation |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges to install apps |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | System command execution affects system scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact due to command execution |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact due to command execution |
| A      | H     | High availability impact due to command execution |

#####798#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in QuantumCloud ChatBot with AI. This issue affects ChatBot with AI: from n/a through 5.1.0.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data  
- **Effect:** Typically, deserialization vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or escalate privileges by sending crafted serialized objects.  
- **Affected product:** QuantumCloud ChatBot with AI, versions up to 5.1.0.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities are often exploitable remotely if the application accepts serialized data over the network.  
- Since this is a chatbot, it likely accepts input over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Deserialization of untrusted data usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted data.  
- However, sometimes it requires specific conditions or knowledge of the serialized format.  
- Given no mention of special conditions, assume low complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Usually, deserialization vulnerabilities can be exploited without authentication if the service accepts unauthenticated input.  
- No mention of needing authentication.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is in a chatbot that processes input automatically.  
- No user interaction required for the exploit to succeed.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities often allow code execution or impact beyond the vulnerable component, potentially affecting the entire system.  
- Since the vulnerability likely allows remote code execution or similar impact, the scope is likely changed.  
- **Value:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to data disclosure.  
- Given the severity, assume high confidentiality impact.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution or manipulation of data is possible.  
- Integrity is highly impacted.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Exploitation can cause denial of service or system crash.  
- Availability is highly impacted.  
- **Value:** High (H)

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over network                                         |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No authentication needed                                                  |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                              |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact extends beyond vulnerable component                                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | High data disclosure impact                                               |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | High data manipulation or code execution impact                          |
| Availability (A)     | H      | High impact on availability (DoS or crash)                               |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
= 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.142  
= 6.66 - 0.46 = 6.20

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else if Scope Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (6.20 + 3.89), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 10.09, 10))  
= round_up(min(10.9, 10))  
= 10.0

#####799#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 1.0
- Affected file: admin/edit-doctor-specialization.php
- Attack vector: Manipulation of the argument "doctorspecilization"
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Rated as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable by manipulating a web application parameter.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection typically requires low complexity if the input is directly injectable without additional conditions.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web application parameter (admin/edit-doctor-specialization.php).  
- The path suggests an admin page, but the description does not specify if authentication is required.  
- However, since the parameter is "doctorspecilization" and the file is under "admin", it is likely that some privileges are required to access this page.  
- But the description does not explicitly say "unauthenticated" or "authenticated".  
- Given the typical scenario for admin pages, **Low (L)** privileges are required (e.g., a logged-in user but not necessarily admin).  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker manipulates a parameter directly; no user interaction is needed for the exploit.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection affects the database, which is typically part of the same security authority as the application.  
- The vulnerability allows data manipulation but does not indicate privilege escalation beyond the application boundary.  
- Usually, SQLi vulnerabilities have **Scope Unchanged (U)** unless they allow control over other components.  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data disclosure.  
- Since it is rated critical and the exploit is public, it likely leads to significant data leakage.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow data modification.  
- The description mentions "manipulation" which implies data integrity impact.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes cause denial of service, but the description does not mention availability impact.  
- Assume **Low (L)** impact due to potential disruption or none if no DoS is implied.  
- Given critical rating and typical SQLi impact, **Low (L)** is reasonable.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

#####800#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the FST_BL_GEOM parsing maxhandle functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115, when compiled as a 32-bit binary. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to memory corruption. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted file.  
- The file must be opened locally by the victim (not remotely over a network).  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file, but no special conditions or timing are mentioned.  
- Opening the file is straightforward, so the complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The victim just needs to open the file; no mention of needing any privileges.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes memory corruption within the application (GTKWave).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption could lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
- Since it's an integer overflow leading to memory corruption, some information disclosure is possible but not guaranteed.  
- Assign **Low (L)** to reflect potential limited confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to modification of data or code execution.  
- So, **High (H)** is appropriate because integrity can be fully compromised.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **Low (L)** or **High (H)**? Since the description does not specify a full denial of service, but memory corruption often leads to crashes, **Low (L)** is reasonable.

- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)

#####801#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in POSCMS v4.6.2, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to /index.php?c=install&m=index&step=2&is_install_db=0.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited via a web request to a URL parameter.  
- This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to send a crafted payload to a specific URL parameter.  
- No indication of special conditions or timing required.  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities have low complexity if no special conditions are mentioned.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is exploiting an installation page (`install`), which often is accessible without authentication during setup.  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Stored XSS typically requires a victim user to visit a page where the malicious script is stored and executed.  
- The attacker stores the payload, but the script executes in the context of another user.  
- So, user interaction is required (the victim must load the page).  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code in the context of the web application.  
- Usually, XSS affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- No indication of DoS or availability impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: L (Low)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= Roundup(5.33) = 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Tenda AC15 firmware.
- Affects function `saveParentControlInfo` in `/goform/saveParentControlInfo`.
- Stack-based buffer overflow via manipulation of the argument `urls`.
- Attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Vendor did not respond.
- Severity declared as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Likely over the network (e.g., HTTP request to `/goform/saveParentControlInfo`).  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.  
- Usually, buffer overflow via argument manipulation is straightforward if the attacker can send crafted input.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely.  
- No mention that authentication or privileges are required.  
- Likely no privileges required.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is initiated remotely by sending a crafted request.  
- No mention that a user must perform any action (e.g., click a link).  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in a function of the device firmware.  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.  
- If the vulnerability allows control over other components beyond the vulnerable component, scope is changed.  
- Usually, in embedded devices, a buffer overflow in a network-facing function can lead to code execution in the same component.  
- No explicit indication that the impact crosses privilege boundaries or components.  
- Assume **Scope = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.  
- No explicit mention of data disclosure.  
- However, code execution can lead to data exposure.  
- Since it's a critical vulnerability, assume at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Usually, buffer overflow can lead to full compromise.  
- **C = High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow attacker to execute arbitrary code, modify data.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- **A = High (H)**

### Summary of Base Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.08

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[5.88 + 4.08, 10])  
= Roundup(9.96) = 10.0

#####803#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A Universal Cross Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability in ClassLink OneClick Extension through 10.8 allows remote attackers to inject JavaScript into any webpage. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-48612.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Universal Cross Site Scripting (UXSS)  
- **Impact:** Remote attackers can inject JavaScript into any webpage.  
- **Affected component:** Browser extension (ClassLink OneClick Extension)  
- **Attack vector:** Remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject script into any webpage.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by a remote attacker. Since this is a browser extension vulnerability that can be triggered remotely (e.g., via web content or remote webpage), the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   UXSS vulnerabilities typically require no special conditions beyond visiting a malicious or crafted webpage. The description does not mention any special conditions or complex steps. So, **Low (L)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the victim's machine or extension. So, **None (N)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   UXSS usually requires the user to visit a malicious or crafted webpage to trigger the vulnerability. This means user interaction is required. So, **Required (R)**.

5. **Scope (S):**  
   The vulnerability allows injection of JavaScript into any webpage, which means the impact crosses from the extension's scope to the webpage's scope (different security boundaries). This indicates **Scope Changed (C)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   Injecting JavaScript into any webpage can lead to theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens). This is a high confidentiality impact. So, **High (H)**.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   Injected JavaScript can modify webpage content or perform actions on behalf of the user, so integrity is also highly impacted. So, **High (H)**.

8. **Availability (A):**  
   The description does not mention any impact on availability. So, **None (N)**.

---

### Summary of metrics:

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 7.52 * 0.8064 ≈ 6.06

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= 1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)  
= 1.08 * (6.06 + 2.82)  
= 1.08 * 8.88 ≈ 9.59

Rounded up to one decimal place: **9.6**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 1.0
- Affected file: admin/patient-search.php
- Attack vector: Manipulation of the argument `searchdata`
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- Severity: Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is exploitable by manipulating an argument in a web application.
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- SQL Injection typically requires low complexity if the input is directly used in a query without sanitization.
- No mention of special conditions or timing.
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker manipulates a parameter in a web application.
- Usually, no privileges are required to send input to a web application parameter.
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends a crafted request; no user interaction is needed.
- **Value: None (N)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     |
| Availability (A)     | L     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**

= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]

= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78] = 1 - 0.151 = 0.849

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**

= 6.42 * 0.849 = 5.45

**Base Score =**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))

= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.88, 10)) = round_up(9.33) = 9.3

#####805#####
Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in "Republish Old Posts":

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affects: Republish Old Posts plugin, versions up to 1.21
- Impact: CSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
CSRF attacks are typically executed over the network since the attacker lures the victim to a malicious website or link.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
CSRF attacks require the victim to be tricked into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or loading a page). This is generally considered low complexity because no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need privileges on the target system; however, the victim must be authenticated (have privileges) to perform the action. For CVSS, the metric considers the attacker's privileges, which are none.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
CSRF requires the victim to interact (e.g., click a link or visit a page).  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
CSRF usually does not directly disclose information. However, depending on the action, it might allow reading or changing data. In this case, the description does not mention data disclosure.  
- **C:N (None)**

**Integrity (I):**  
CSRF can allow unauthorized modification of data or state. Since the vulnerability allows an attacker to cause the victim to perform actions, integrity is impacted at least at a low level.  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
CSRF generally does not impact availability.  
- **A:N (None)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)  

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)])**  
= 6.42 * (1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)])  
= 6.42 * (1 - [1 * 0.78 * 1])  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(4.23) = 4.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####806#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in the search work request feature.
- Affects: Archibus app 4.0.3 for iOS.
- The app uses a local database synchronized with a central web server.
- The SQL injection allows performing queries on the local database.
- The injection occurs in the app on the iOS device.
- The injection is in the local app, not directly on the server.
- The injection is triggered when the app is opened or the refresh button is used.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the iOS app, which uses a local database.  
- The injection is performed locally on the device, not remotely over the network.  
- The user must interact with the app (open it or refresh).  
- The attacker likely needs local access to the device or the app.  
- Since the injection is on the local database inside the app, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL injection is generally straightforward if input is not sanitized.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complex steps.  
- The injection happens when the app is opened or refreshed, which is normal behavior.  
- Therefore, the attack complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to perform the injection on the app.  
- Since the app is on the user's device, the attacker must have access to the app.  
- The description does not mention needing elevated privileges on the device.  
- The attacker likely needs to be the user or have access to the app's input.  
- This suggests **None (N)** if the attacker can supply input without privileges, or **Low (L)** if some user-level privileges are needed.  
- Since the injection is in the app's search feature, presumably accessible to any user of the app, **Privileges Required = None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The injection happens when the app is opened or the refresh button is used.  
- The attacker must cause the user to open or refresh the app, or the attacker themselves must perform the action.  
- Since the injection is triggered by user action (opening or refreshing), **User Interaction = Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the local database within the app on the device.  
- It does not affect resources beyond the app's security scope (e.g., the central server).  
- Therefore, the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL injection allows performing queries on the local database.  
- This can lead to unauthorized reading of data.  
- The impact on confidentiality is at least **Low (L)**.  
- The description does not specify full data disclosure, so not High.

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL injection can allow modification of data.  
- The description does not specify if data can be modified, only that queries can be performed.  
- Since injection typically allows modification, but here it only mentions queries, we assume **Low (L)** or **None (N)**.  
- To be conservative, assume **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (since Scope=U)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.52 + 1.83) = Round_up (4.35) = 4.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An arbitrary File upload vulnerability exists in Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 and prior at com.java2nb.common.controller.FileController: upload(). An attacker can pass in specially crafted filename parameter to perform arbitrary File download."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves uploading a file via a web controller, which is typically accessible over the network.  
- The attacker can send a specially crafted filename parameter remotely.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to pass a specially crafted filename parameter.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- So, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.  
- Usually, file upload endpoints are accessible without authentication or with minimal privileges.  
- Since the attacker can exploit this by just sending a crafted parameter, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker directly sends the request; no user interaction is required.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary file download via the upload endpoint.  
- The impact is on the same component (the application itself).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can perform arbitrary file download, which means they can read sensitive files.  
- This leads to a High impact on confidentiality.  
- C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability is about file download, not modification.  
- No indication that the attacker can modify files or data.  
- I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
- A = None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact (arbitrary file download) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.44) = 6 * 0.56 = 3.36

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.36 + 3.89, 10)) = round_up(7.25) = 7.3 → 7.3 rounds to 7.3 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

#####808#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An injection issue was addressed with improved input validation. This issue is fixed in macOS Sonoma 14.4, macOS Monterey 12.7.4, macOS Ventura 13.6.5. An app may be able to elevate privileges."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type of issue:** Injection vulnerability (likely code injection or command injection).
- **Impact:** An app may be able to elevate privileges.
- **Affected software:** macOS versions.
- **Attack vector:** Since it involves an app, the attack likely requires local access (the attacker must run or control an app on the system).
- **Privileges required:** The attacker is an app, so likely some privileges are needed to run the app, but the vulnerability allows privilege escalation (elevation).
- **User interaction:** Possibly none, if the attacker controls the app.
- **Scope:** Since privileges are elevated, the scope likely changes (from app privileges to higher privileges).
- **Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability:** Elevation of privileges usually impacts integrity and possibly confidentiality and availability depending on what the attacker can do with elevated privileges.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must have an app running on the system. This implies **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Injection vulnerabilities are often straightforward if the attacker controls input. No mention of special conditions. So **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is an app, so some privileges are needed to run the app. Since the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, the attacker must have some privileges but not high privileges. So **Low (L)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker controls the app, so no additional user interaction is needed. So **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, meaning the impact crosses privilege boundaries. So **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Elevation of privileges can lead to access to sensitive data. So **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Elevation of privileges allows modification of system or app data. So **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No explicit mention of availability impact, but privilege escalation can lead to denial of service. To be conservative, assign **Low (L)**.

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local app required |
| AC     | L     | Injection with low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Some privileges needed to run app |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Privilege escalation changes scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Possible low availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.85

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 7.52 * 0.849 ≈ 6.39

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= Roundup(Min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 * (6.39 + 1.85) = 1.08 * 8.24 = 8.90 → 8.9

**CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L**

#####809#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: PDF Flipbook, 3D Flipbook – DearFlip plugin for WordPress, versions ≤ 2.2.26
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied data
- Attack scenario: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions can inject arbitrary scripts
- Impact: Scripts execute when any user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated and inject scripts via the plugin interface.  
- The injection happens through the web interface, and the attack can be performed remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs contributor-level permissions, but no other complex conditions are mentioned.  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization, which is straightforward to exploit once permissions are obtained.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor-level or higher permissions (authenticated user with some privileges).  
- Contributor-level is typically considered Low privileges (not admin).  
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires a victim user to visit the injected page for the script to execute.  
- So, user interaction is required (the victim must view the page).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin environment).  
- The impact is on the same component (plugin and WordPress site).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the victim user.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- A = None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector (remote over web) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | L     | Requires contributor-level privileges (low) |
| UI     | R     | Requires victim user to view injected page |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (data theft possible) |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact (script injection) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

#####810#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One security agent.  
- Allows a local attacker to escalate privileges.  
- Attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.  

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The attacker must have local code execution on the system. This implies the attack is performed locally, not over the network or adjacent network.  
   **Value:** Local (L)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   The attacker must already have low-privileged code execution, but no other special conditions or environment requirements are mentioned. This suggests the attack complexity is low.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code, which means some privileges are required, but not high privileges.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   No mention of needing another user to perform any action. The attacker is local and presumably can trigger the exploit themselves.  
   **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which means the attacker can affect resources beyond their initial privileges. This usually means the scope is changed.  
   **Value:** Changed (C)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   Privilege escalation typically impacts confidentiality to some extent, but the description does not specify data disclosure. Usually, privilege escalation implies at least Low impact on confidentiality.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   Privilege escalation allows the attacker to modify system or application state beyond their initial privileges, so integrity is impacted.  
   **Value:** High (H)

8. **Availability (A):**  
   No mention of impact on availability.  
   **Value:** None (N)

---

### Summary of Metric Values:

- AV: L (Local)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: L (Low)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: N (None)

#####811#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Insecure Permissions vulnerability in BossCMS v.1.3.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges via the init function in admin.class.php component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is described as "local," meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV = L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; it implies straightforward exploitation once local access is obtained.  
  **AC = L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "local attacker" who can execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges. Since the attacker can escalate privileges, it implies the attacker starts with some privileges but not high privileges. Usually, "local attacker" implies at least low privileges.  
  So, the attacker requires **Low** privileges to exploit.  
  **PR = L (Low)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly.  
  **UI = N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which means the impact crosses security boundaries (from low privileges to higher privileges). This indicates a **Changed** scope.  
  **S = C (Changed)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges, which likely leads to full system compromise, including confidentiality impact.  
  **C = H (High)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation imply full integrity compromise.  
  **I = H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation can also impact availability (e.g., deleting files, shutting down services).  
  **A = H (High)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction |
| S      | C     | Privilege escalation changes scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.52 + 6.88) = Roundup (9.40) = 9.4

#####812#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
In OpenHarmony v3.2.2 and prior versions, a local attacker can cause a multimedia audio crash by modifying a released pointer.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is local ("local attacker"). So, AV = Local (L).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Modifying a released pointer typically requires some knowledge but is generally straightforward for a local attacker. So, AC = Low (L).

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is local, but the description does not specify if any privileges are needed. Since it says "local attacker" without specifying elevated privileges, assume no privileges required. PR = None (N).

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any user interaction required. The attacker causes the crash by modifying a pointer, presumably directly. UI = None (N).

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a multimedia audio crash. Crashing a component may or may not affect other components or the system. Since it is a crash in multimedia audio, likely the impact is limited to the component itself, so Scope is Unchanged (U).

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description only mentions a crash, no data disclosure. So, C = None (N).

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description does not mention data modification or corruption beyond causing a crash. So, I = None (N).

- **Availability (A):**  
  The crash causes a denial of service to the multimedia audio component, so availability is impacted. The impact is likely limited to the multimedia audio service, so Low (L).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local attacker |
| AC     | L     | No special complexity mentioned |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Crash causes availability impact (low) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.307 ≈ 2.52

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.52, 10))  
= round_up(3.93)  
= 3.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####813#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in ClickToTweet.Com Click To Tweet allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Click To Tweet: from n/a through 2.0.14.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the affected web page.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a web application vulnerability, the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network by sending crafted input that gets stored and later executed in a victim's browser.  
- **Privileges Required:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities do not require any privileges to exploit. The attacker just needs to submit malicious input (e.g., via a form or URL).  
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the page containing the stored malicious script for the attack to succeed, so user interaction is required.  
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the web application and the impact is on the client (victim's browser). However, in CVSS v3.1, the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)** for XSS because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application).  
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - **Confidentiality:** XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, so **Low (L)** or **High (H)**? Usually, XSS is rated as **Low (L)** because it depends on the victim's interaction and the attacker can steal some data but not full system compromise.  
  - **Integrity:** XSS can allow an attacker to modify the content seen by the user, so **Low (L)**.  
  - **Availability:** Usually, XSS does not impact availability, so **None (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond submitting malicious input.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  No privileges are needed to exploit.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must visit the page containing the malicious script.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (web application).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Some sensitive information can be disclosed.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  The attacker can modify the content seen by the user.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No impact on availability.

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in swadeshswain Before After Image Slider WP allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Before After Image Slider WP: from n/a through 2.2.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the affected web page.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a web plugin vulnerability, the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network by sending crafted input that gets stored and later executed in the victim's browser.  
- **Privileges Required:** None, as the attacker only needs to submit input (e.g., via a form or comment) that gets stored.  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the payload to execute.  
- **Scope:** Unchanged, because the vulnerability affects resources within the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal cookies or session tokens, but not full system compromise)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify displayed content or perform actions on behalf of the user)  
  - Availability: None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.19)  
= 5.2 (Medium severity)

- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
MRCMS 3.0 contains an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability in /admin/file/edit.do as the incoming path parameter is not filtered.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted request to a web application endpoint (/admin/file/edit.do). This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description states the path parameter is not filtered, implying no special conditions or environment requirements. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The vulnerability is in an admin path (/admin/file/edit.do), which might imply that the attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user. However, the description does not explicitly say authentication is required or that the attacker must have privileges.  
  Since it is an arbitrary file read via a path parameter and no mention of authentication is made, it is likely that no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends a crafted request directly to the vulnerable endpoint. No user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  Arbitrary file read affects confidentiality but does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component. The vulnerability is local to the web application and does not affect other components or privileges outside the scope of the vulnerable component.  
  Therefore, scope is **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary file read allows the attacker to read sensitive files, which impacts confidentiality. The impact is likely **High (H)** because arbitrary file read can disclose sensitive information.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The vulnerability is a read-only issue; no modification of data is implied.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **Value:** None (N)

#####816#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Discourse allows guest users to access secure upload URLs associated with posts even when login is required. This implies unauthorized access to resources that should be protected.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves accessing URLs over the network (web platform).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description says "under very specific circumstances," implying some conditions must be met, but no indication that these are difficult or require special conditions beyond normal use.  
- "Very specific circumstances" suggests a bit more complexity than usual, so AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Guest users (no login) can access the URLs.  
- So, no privileges are required. PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is a guest user accessing URLs directly. No mention of needing another user to perform any action.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows access to secure upload URLs associated with posts.  
- The issue is within the same security authority (the web application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Guest users can access secure upload URLs, which likely contain sensitive or private data.  
- This leads to a loss of confidentiality.  
- The description suggests unauthorized read access, but not full disclosure of all data.  
- So, Confidentiality = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modifying data or uploads.  
- Integrity impact = None (N).

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- Availability impact = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: H (High)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: N (None)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:H (0.44)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.56

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[1.41 + 2.56, 10])  
= Roundup(3.97) = 4.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Skyworth Router CM5100 (version 4.1.1.24).
- Insufficient validation of user input for the Network Name (SSID) parameter on the web interface.
- Remote attacker can supply specially crafted input via the web interface.
- Successful exploitation allows stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- Web interface is accessible over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply specially crafted input; no special conditions or timing required.  
- This suggests low complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and can supply input to the web interface without authentication mentioned.  
- Usually, web interfaces may require authentication, but the description does not mention any authentication or privileges required.  
- Assume no privileges required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is stored XSS, which typically requires a victim user to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., viewing the stored malicious SSID or page).  
- The attacker does not need user interaction, but the victim user must interact with the malicious content for the impact.  
- According to CVSS guidelines, if exploitation requires a user to trigger the payload (e.g., victim clicks or views), UI is Required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web interface and the router system).  
- Stored XSS typically does not affect other components or privileges beyond the web application.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.68) = Roundup(5.19) = 5.2 (Medium severity)

#####818#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Flient Smart Door Lock v1.0 has a vulnerability due to use of default credentials on a debug interface. An attacker can unlock the door by replacing the fingerprint stored on the scanner.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves accessing a debug interface remotely or locally?  
- The description does not explicitly say if the debug interface is accessible over the network or only locally. However, debug interfaces are often accessible locally or via adjacent network (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).  
- Since it is a smart door lock, the debug interface is likely accessible via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (adjacent network).  
- **AV = Adjacent (A)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker uses default credentials and replaces the fingerprint.  
- Default credentials imply low complexity.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker uses default credentials, so no prior privileges are needed.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker replaces the fingerprint stored on the scanner.  
- Does the attack require a user to do something?  
- The description does not mention any user interaction required.  
- The attacker can perform the attack independently.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows unlocking the door, which is a security control outside the vulnerable component (the debug interface).  
- The impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects a different security scope (physical security).  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can unlock the door, but no mention of data disclosure.  
- No confidentiality impact.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker replaces the fingerprint stored on the scanner, which is an integrity violation.  
- This is a high integrity impact because the attacker can modify authentication data.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

- AV: Adjacent (A)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Changed (C)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:A = 0.62  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.82

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56 ≈ 4.21

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact > 0:  
Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (4.21 + 2.82) = Roundup (7.03) = 7.1

#####819#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- The router console is accessible without authentication at the "data" field.
- A user needs to be logged in to modify configuration.
- Session state is shared, so an anonymous user can execute commands in the context of an authenticated user if any user is logged in.
- If the logged-in user has admin privileges, the anonymous user can create a new admin user with a chosen password.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves accessing the router console remotely via the "data" field (likely a network service).  
- No indication that physical or local access is required.  
- The attacker can be anonymous and does not need to be on the same local network necessarily.  
- Therefore, **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to find a way to access the "data" field without authentication and exploit session sharing.  
- No special conditions or timing required are mentioned.  
- The attack seems straightforward once the vulnerability is known.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is anonymous (no privileges) but can execute commands in the context of an authenticated user if any user is logged in.  
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is required.  
- The victim user is logged in, but this is a state, not an interaction.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker can create a new admin user via the webadmin service configuration commands.  
- This implies that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the initially vulnerable component (the "data" field).  
- The impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects the system's security state.  
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can execute commands in the context of an authenticated user, including admin commands.  
- This implies full access to confidential information.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can create a new admin user, which is a complete compromise of integrity.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No direct mention of availability impact (e.g., DoS).  
- The attacker can create admin users but no indication of availability disruption.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.472  
  ≈ 3.88

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 1]  
  = 1 - 0.1936  
  = 0.8064

- Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * (0.8064 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.8064 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 * 0.7774 - 3.25 * (0.7864)^15

Calculate (0.7864)^15:  
Approximately 0.7864^15 ≈ 0.028 (using logarithms or approximation)

So:  
Impact ≈ 7.52 * 0.7774 - 3.25 * 0.028  
= 5.846 - 0.091  
= 5.755

- Base Score (Scope Changed) =  
  If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
  Else score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))

Calculate:  
1.08 * (5.755 + 3.88) = 1.08 * 9.635 = 10.4058 → capped at 10

**Final Base Score = 10.0 (Critical)**

#####820#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Heap Buffer Overflow vulnerability in qpdf 11.9.0 allows attackers to crash the application via the std::__shared_count() function at /bits/shared_ptr_base.h.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in a software library (qpdf).  
- Typically, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the software processes untrusted input over a network.  
- Since qpdf is a PDF processing tool, it usually processes files locally, but it can be invoked in various contexts.  
- However, the description does not specify remote exploitation or network access.  
- Given the lack of explicit network context, but considering qpdf is a command-line tool that processes files locally, the most reasonable assumption is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities usually require crafted input but no special conditions beyond that.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious file to qpdf.  
- No mention that the attacker needs any privileges on the system.  
- If the attacker can run qpdf or cause it to process a file, no privileges are required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must cause qpdf to process a malicious file.  
- This implies the user (or system) must open or process the file.  
- So, user interaction is **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash of the application (denial of service).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description only mentions crashing the application (denial of service).  
- No mention of data disclosure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The application can be crashed, causing denial of service.  
- So, **Low (L)** (since it is a crash, not a complete system shutdown).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:N (0.0)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.24)  
= 3.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####821#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem.
- The issue is a use-after-free (UAF) of an inner map when updating or deleting it.
- The inner map may be freed prematurely without proper synchronization (RCU grace period).
- This can lead to a use-after-free condition when a BPF program accesses the inner map.
- The fix defers freeing the inner map until after RCU grace periods, preventing the UAF.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability occurs in the Linux kernel BPF subsystem.  
- BPF programs can be loaded remotely or locally, but typically, loading or updating BPF maps requires local privileges or at least local access.  
- The description does not mention remote exploitation over the network.  
- BPF programs are usually loaded locally or via local interfaces (e.g., via `bpftool` or system calls).  
- Therefore, **Local (L)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires updating or deleting an inner map in a specific way.  
- The use-after-free occurs due to a race condition with RCU grace periods and ref-counting.  
- Exploiting this likely requires precise timing and knowledge of kernel internals.  
- This suggests **High (H)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To update or delete BPF maps, the attacker must have the ability to load or modify BPF programs or maps.  
- This generally requires **Low (L)** privileges (e.g., unprivileged users can load some BPF programs, but modifying inner maps may require elevated privileges).  
- However, in many systems, loading BPF programs requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN or similar.  
- Given that, **High (H)** privileges are likely required.  
- But since the description does not specify privilege escalation, and BPF programs can sometimes be loaded by unprivileged users (depending on kernel config), let's assume **Low (L)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by updating or deleting inner maps.  
- This is a programmatic action, no user interaction needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on kernel memory (use-after-free).  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (kernel).  
- No privilege escalation or impact on other components.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to information disclosure if the freed memory is read.  
- The description does not explicitly mention info leak, but UAF can cause data leaks.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can allow modification of kernel memory or cause corruption.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause kernel crashes (denial of service).  
- So, **Low (L)**.

| Attack Complexity (AC)  | H     | Exploitation requires race condition and timing                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L     | Low privileges needed to update/delete BPF maps (assuming unprivileged BPF loading)       |
| User Interaction (UI)   | N     | No user interaction required                                                              |
| Scope (S)              | U     | Impact within the same security scope (kernel)                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)     | L     | Possible info disclosure via UAF                                                          |
| Integrity (I)           | L     | Possible integrity impact via memory corruption                                            |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope=U)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.1277 ≈ 1.05

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1-C)*(1-I)*(1-A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1-0.22)*(1-0.22)*(1-0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78*0.78*0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score = round_up(min(Exploitability + Impact, 10))**  
= round_up(1.05 + 3.38) = round_up(4.43) = 4.4

#####822#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In OpenDDS through 3.27, there is a segmentation fault for a DataWriter with a large value of resource_limits.max_samples. The vendor notes that the product is not designed to handle a max_samples value that is too large for the system memory.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The issue is a segmentation fault caused by setting a large value for `max_samples`.
- This likely leads to a crash (denial of service).
- The fault occurs when the application is configured with a large parameter value.
- The vendor states this is a misuse or unsupported configuration, implying the fault is triggered by user input or configuration.
- The segmentation fault is a crash, so the impact is primarily on availability.
- The attack vector is likely local or adjacent, depending on how the attacker can influence the `max_samples` value.
- Since this is a configuration parameter, it is likely set by the user or administrator.
- The description does not mention remote exploitation or network access.
- The segmentation fault is a crash, so integrity and confidentiality impacts are likely none.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- How is the vulnerability exploited?  
- The attacker must set a large `max_samples` value. This is a configuration parameter, likely set locally or via an API.  
- No indication that this can be done remotely over the network.  
- Could it be adjacent? Possibly, if the attacker is on the same network and can influence the parameter. But more likely local because it involves configuration.  
- **Choose:** Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Is the attack easy or does it require special conditions?  
- The attacker must set an unusually large value for `max_samples`. This is a specific condition but not complex.  
- The vendor states the product is not designed to handle this, implying it is a misuse rather than a complex exploit.  
- **Choose:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Does the attacker need privileges?  
- Setting `max_samples` likely requires some level of privilege (e.g., user or admin) because it is a configuration parameter.  
- If the attacker is a normal user who can configure the DataWriter, then Low (L). If only admin can configure, then High (H).  
- Since DataWriter configuration is typically done by the application or admin, assume Low (L) privileges required.  
- **Choose:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does the attack require user interaction?  
- The attacker is the user setting the parameter, so no additional user interaction is needed.  
- **Choose:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- The segmentation fault crashes the DataWriter component.  
- No indication that other components or system resources are affected.  
- **Choose:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Is there any data disclosure?  
- No indication of confidentiality impact.  
- **Choose:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Is data integrity affected?  
- No indication of data corruption or modification.  
- **Choose:** None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- Does the vulnerability cause a denial of service?  
- Yes, segmentation fault causes crash, impacting availability.  
- Severity is likely high because the component crashes.  
- **Choose:** High (H)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local configuration required |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to trigger |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges to configure |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Crash causes high availability impact |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of:  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else, score = min((Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
= 3.59 + 1.83 = 5.42 → 5.4

### CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.83

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact Score = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**

#####824#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net: qualcomm: rmnet component.
- The issue is a global out-of-bounds (OOB) read due to an incorrect assignment of a larger maxtype.
- The OOB read occurs when parsing netlink attributes.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted netlink message.
- The exploit involves reading memory out-of-bounds, which can lead to information disclosure or system instability.
- The attack vector is through netlink, which is a kernel interface accessible locally or remotely depending on configuration.
- The bug is triggered by a user-space process sending netlink messages (e.g., syz-executor).
- The vulnerability is a read (out-of-bounds read), so it impacts confidentiality primarily.
- No indication of privilege escalation or code execution.
- The bug is triggered by a user sending a netlink message, so user interaction is not required beyond sending the message.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (kernel memory read).

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered via netlink messages. Netlink sockets are accessible locally (from the same machine) but not remotely over the network by default.  
- Netlink is considered **Adjacent (A)** because it requires local network or IPC access, not remote network access.  
- **AV:A**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires crafting a specific netlink message with a malformed maxtype.  
- This is not trivial but also not highly complex for an attacker with knowledge of the kernel interface.  
- No indication of random conditions or race conditions.  
- Considered **Low (L)** complexity.  
- **AC:L**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be able to send netlink messages to the kernel.  
- Typically, sending netlink messages to certain kernel subsystems requires **Low (L)** privileges (e.g., unprivileged user can send some netlink messages, but some require CAP_NET_ADMIN).  
- The description does not specify if CAP_NET_ADMIN is required, but since it involves rtnetlink (network interface configuration), it likely requires **Low (L)** privileges (non-root but with some capabilities).  
- **PR:L**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends the crafted netlink message directly; no other user interaction is required.  
- **UI:N**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects kernel memory read via netlink parsing.  
- The impact is within the kernel security scope; no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the kernel's security authority.  
- **Scope: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to information disclosure.  
- The impact is **Low (L)** because it leaks some kernel memory but not full system compromise.  
- **C:L**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data.  
- **I:N**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of denial of service or crash impact.  
- The bug is a read, not a write or crash.  
- **A:N**

### Step 2: Summary of Base Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Netlink is adjacent network (local IPC) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to craft malformed netlink message |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (likely CAP_NET_ADMIN) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond sending message |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged, kernel memory read only |
| C      | L     | Out-of-bounds read leads to partial info disclosure |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) with Scope Unchanged
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.62 = 5.0964  
5.0964 × 0.77 = 3.9204  
3.9204 × 0.62 = 2.4306  
2.4306 × 0.85 = 2.066

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.4124

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.4124 + 2.066, 10))  
= round_up(3.4784)  
= 3.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####825#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An integer overflow vulnerability in LoadPixelDataRLE4 function in PluginBMP.cpp in Freeimage 3.18.0 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service and/or run arbitrary code."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a function that processes image data (LoadPixelDataRLE4).  
- Typically, image processing vulnerabilities are exploitable by providing a crafted file, which is often delivered over a network or via user interaction.  
- Since the attacker can supply a crafted image file remotely (e.g., via a network service or file download), the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Integer overflow vulnerabilities in image parsing often require crafted input but no special conditions beyond that.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing constraints.  
- So, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges to trigger the vulnerability, as it involves processing a crafted image file.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must get the victim to open or process the crafted image file.  
- This requires user interaction (e.g., opening the file).  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows "obtain sensitive information, cause denial of service, and/or run arbitrary code."  
- Running arbitrary code usually means the attacker can execute code beyond the vulnerable component, potentially affecting other components or the system.  
- This suggests the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can obtain sensitive information.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can run arbitrary code, which implies full control and ability to modify data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker can cause denial of service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A command injection vulnerability in Ivanti Sentry prior to 9.19.0 allows unauthenticated threat actor to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the appliance within the same physical or logical network.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must be within the same physical or logical network. This implies the attacker is not remote over the internet but adjacent in the network.  
  **Value:** Adjacent (A)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Command injection is typically straightforward once access is available.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for exploitation.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary commands on the underlying OS of the appliance. This suggests the impact crosses from the vulnerable component (Ivanti Sentry application) to the underlying OS, which is a different security scope.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure. This is a high impact on confidentiality.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary command execution allows full control, so integrity is fully compromised.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary command execution can disrupt or disable the system, so availability is fully compromised.  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) — since Scope is Changed, PR:N = 0.85
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * ( (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15 )  
= 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * ( (0.915 - 0.02)^15 )  
= 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895^15)  
= 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.166  
= 6.66 - 0.54 = 6.12

**Base Score = min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)**  
= 6.12 + 2.82 = 8.94 → Rounded up to 8.9

#####827#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Code-projects Simple School Management System 1.0 allows Authentication Bypass via the username and password parameters at School/index.php."

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is an authentication bypass via parameters in a web application (School/index.php). This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Authentication bypass via username and password parameters suggests no special conditions or environment needed, likely low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since this is an authentication bypass, the attacker does not need any privileges beforehand.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects authentication in the same application scope; no indication that it affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Authentication bypass can allow unauthorized access to data, so confidentiality is impacted. The impact is likely partial, not full system compromise.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Unauthorized access may allow modification of data, but the description does not explicitly mention data modification. However, authentication bypass often allows some level of integrity impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **Value:** None (N)

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network                                     |

| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible unauthorized modification, but limited                         |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
= approx 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
= approx 2.52

**Base Score =**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.52 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.41)  
= 6.4

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####828#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: stack-based buffer overflow via manipulation of argument v33 in HTTP POST request handler.
- Affected component: /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi?action=login&flag=1, function main.
- Attack vector: remotely launched.
- Exploit publicly disclosed and may be used.
- No vendor response.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument in an HTTP POST request.  
- No special conditions or environment required are mentioned.  
- This suggests low complexity.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attack is launched remotely via HTTP POST to a login CGI script.  
- No mention of needing any privileges or authentication.  
- Likely no privileges required.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request.  
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the HTTP POST request handler of the device firmware.  
- Usually, buffer overflows in a process can lead to code execution within the same security scope (same component/process).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., kernel or other components).  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution, which may allow reading sensitive information.  
- Since the vulnerability is critical and allows remote code execution, confidentiality impact is likely High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Remote code execution allows modification of data and system state.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Availability impact is High (H).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | H     | Potential full confidentiality compromise |
| I      | H     | Potential full integrity compromise |
| A      | H     | Potential full availability compromise |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or standard tables:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.77)  
= 9.8

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####829#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
The WP TripAdvisor Review Slider WordPress plugin before version 11.9 does not sanitize and escape some settings, allowing high privilege users (e.g., admin) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (such as in multisite setups).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, which is typically exploited via the web interface.  
- The attacker must interact with the plugin through the network (e.g., HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability involves stored XSS due to lack of sanitization.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond submitting crafted input.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description states "high privilege users such as admin" can exploit this.  
- So, the attacker must have high privileges.  
- PR = High (H).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Stored XSS requires a victim user to view the malicious content for the attack to have an effect.  
- The attacker injects the payload, but another user must load the page to trigger the XSS.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the plugin's settings and allows XSS.  
- XSS typically impacts the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This implies a Low impact on confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of users.  
- This implies a Low impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A = None (N).

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:H (High)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 * 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 * 0.27 = 1.452  
1.452 * 0.62 = 0.900

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6 * 0.3916  
= 2.3496

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.3496 + 0.900, 10))  
= round_up(3.2496)  
= 3.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####830#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- CubeFS (cloud-native file storage system) prior to v3.3.1 leaks users' secret keys and access keys in logs.
- The leak occurs when CubeFS creates new users.
- A lower-privileged user with access to the logs can retrieve sensitive information and impersonate higher-privileged users.
- The vulnerability is fixed in v3.3.1.
- No other mitigation besides upgrading.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is a "lower-privileged user with access to the logs."  
- Access to logs implies local or adjacent access, not network-wide.  
- Since logs are typically stored on the system or accessible via local means, this is likely **Local (L)**.  
- If logs were accessible over the network, it would be Network (N), but the description implies local access.  
- **AV = L**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to access logs to retrieve keys.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- This is straightforward, so **Low (L)**.  
- **AC = L**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is a "lower-privileged user with access to the logs."  
- So some privileges are required to access the logs, but not high privileges.  
- This corresponds to **Low (L)** privileges.  
- **PR = L**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker accesses logs directly; no user interaction is needed.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker can impersonate other users with higher privileges by stealing keys.  
- This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Scope is Changed (C)**.  
- **S = C**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Secret keys and access keys are leaked.  
- This is a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.  
- **C = H**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can impersonate other users with higher privileges, which implies they can perform unauthorized actions.  
- This is a **High (H)** integrity impact.  
- **I = H**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Attacker must have local access to logs |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | L     | Attacker has low privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses privilege boundaries |
| C      | H     | Secret keys leaked |
| I      | H     | Can impersonate higher-privileged users |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) (0.68)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

**Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An email address enumeration vulnerability exists in the password reset function of SEO Panel version 4.10.0. This allows an attacker to guess which emails exist on the system."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in the password reset function, which is typically accessible over the network (e.g., via a web interface). The attacker can send requests remotely.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Email enumeration usually requires no special conditions or timing; the attacker just needs to send requests and observe responses.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges to perform enumeration; they can be unauthenticated.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is the one initiating the requests; no other user needs to interact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the SEO Panel application). No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component is described.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Email enumeration leaks information about which email addresses exist. This is a partial disclosure of information, but not full data breach.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  There is no indication that the attacker can modify data or affect integrity.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No impact on availability is described.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network access to password reset function |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the same scope |
| C      | L     | Partial information disclosure (email existence) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6 * 0.22  
= 1.32

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.32 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(5.21)  
= 5.2

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic (approximate):

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.556  
≈ 8.22 × 0.472  
≈ 3.88

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(9.76)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in jsrsasign before 11.0.0.
- Vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts by exploiting a flaw in RSA PKCS1.5 or RSAOAEP decryption.
- Attacker needs access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.
- No mention of user interaction.
- No mention of privilege requirements.
- The attack targets cryptographic operations, likely remotely (network).
- The impact is on confidentiality (decryption of ciphertext).
- No explicit mention of integrity or availability impact.
- No indication that the scope changes (the vulnerability affects the same component).

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker needs access to ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.
- The vulnerability is in a cryptographic library, which is typically used in software that can be accessed over a network.
- No indication that the attacker must be local or adjacent.
- Therefore, **AV:N (Network)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker needs access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.
- This is a non-trivial requirement, making the attack more complex than a simple exploit.
- Therefore, **AC:H (High)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker needs to have ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.
- The description does not say the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges on the system.
- The attacker only needs ciphertexts, which could be obtained without privileges.
- Therefore, **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention of user interaction required.
- The attacker can perform the attack without user interaction.
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the cryptographic library itself.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Therefore, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can decrypt ciphertexts, which means confidentiality is compromised.
- The impact is significant but limited to the data encrypted with the key.
- This is a **High** impact on confidentiality.
- Therefore, **C:H (High)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- No mention of modification or tampering with data.
- Therefore, **I:N (None)**.

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- Therefore, **A:N (None)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

- AV:N (Network)
- AC:H (High)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:N (None)
- S:U (Unchanged)
- C:H (High)
- I:N (None)
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:H = 0.44
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:H = 0.56
- I:N = 0.0
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability Subscore:**

= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.318  
= 8.22 × 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore:**

= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

= Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.5952 + 2.22)  
= Round_up (5.8152)  
= 5.9

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
SQL injection vulnerability in EmpireCMS v7.5, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive information via the DoExecSql function.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable by "remote attackers," which implies the attack can be performed over a network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL injection vulnerabilities typically require no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. Unless otherwise stated, assume low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "remote attackers," implying no privileges are required to exploit.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required; the attacker can send the payload directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code and obtaining sensitive information. Since arbitrary code execution is possible, it likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component's security scope (e.g., system-level impact). This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **S = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can "obtain sensitive information," so confidentiality is impacted at a high level.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can "execute arbitrary code," which implies full control and thus high integrity impact.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can also impact availability (e.g., deleting files, crashing services). Assume high impact.  
  **A = High (H)**

#####835#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
The spring-security.xsd file inside the spring-security-config jar is world writable, meaning anyone with access to the file system can write to it. This is an example of CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource). No known exploits exist, but it could lead to an exploit if someone modifies the file.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability requires access to the file system where the jar is extracted.  
- This is not exploitable remotely over a network.  
- The attacker must have local access to the system or file system.  
- Therefore, AV = Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The file is world writable once extracted, so no special conditions or complex steps are needed to write to it.  
- However, the attacker must have local access and extract the jar.  
- This is straightforward given local access.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The file is world writable, so no privileges are required to write to it once the jar is extracted.  
- However, the attacker must have access to the file system (local access).  
- Since no privileges are required to modify the file, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit this once they have local access.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the file inside the jar, which is part of the same security scope (the application or system).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows modification of a configuration file, which could lead to information disclosure if exploited.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention information disclosure.  
- The main impact is on integrity and possibly availability.  
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Since the file is world writable, an attacker can modify it, impacting integrity.  
- The description implies potential exploit via modification.  
- I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention availability impact directly.  
- However, modifying configuration files could potentially disrupt service.  
- Given the potential for disruption, but no explicit mention, assign Low (L) as a conservative estimate.  
- A = Low (L)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:L (Low)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.51

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 2.51, 10))  
= round_up(6.73) = 6.7

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
IBM Storage Ceph 5.3z1, 5.3z5, and 6.1z1 could allow an authenticated user on the network to cause a denial of service from RGW.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is "on the network," so the attack can be launched remotely over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity; typically, denial of service vulnerabilities that can be triggered by an authenticated user on the network are low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be "authenticated," so some privileges are required, but not high privileges necessarily. Usually, "authenticated user" corresponds to Low privileges.  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of requiring user interaction; the attacker triggers the DoS directly.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a denial of service "from RGW" (Rados Gateway), which is a component of Ceph. The description does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  Therefore, scope is likely **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The impact is denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service impacts availability. The description suggests the attacker can cause a DoS, but the severity is not specified. Usually, if the DoS is complete or significant, it is High; if partial, Low. Since the description is vague, but typically DoS is considered High impact on availability unless otherwise noted.  
  **A = High (H)**

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.44) = 6 * 0.56 = 3.36

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.36 + 2.68, 10)) = round_up(6.04) = 6.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Acowebs Product Labels For Woocommerce (Sale Badges) allows Stored XSS.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Stored XSS in a web application typically can be exploited remotely over the network by sending crafted input that is stored and later executed in a victim's browser.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities generally require low complexity to exploit if no special conditions are needed. Since this is a stored XSS, the attacker just needs to inject the payload once, and it will be executed for any user viewing the page.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Usually, XSS vulnerabilities in web applications can be exploited without any privileges, as the attacker just needs to submit crafted input (e.g., via a form or comment).  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the victim must visit the vulnerable page or trigger the stored payload for the attack to succeed. This means user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application). The impact is on the application itself, not on other components or systems.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, so confidentiality impact is Low or High depending on the context. Usually, it's considered Low because it depends on the victim's interaction and what data is accessible.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially modifying data or performing unauthorized actions. This is generally considered a Low impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS typically does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

#####838#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
IBM Sterling Secure Proxy 6.0.3 and 6.1.0 allows web pages to be stored locally which can be read by another user on the system.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The vulnerability allows web pages to be stored locally.
- These stored pages can be read by another user on the same system.
- This implies an information disclosure vulnerability.
- The attack requires local access since the attacker must be another user on the same system.
- The vulnerability does not mention any user interaction.
- The scope is likely unchanged because the impact is limited to the same system and does not affect other components.
- The impact is on confidentiality (information disclosure).
- Integrity and availability are not mentioned, so likely no impact.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since the attacker must be another user on the same system, this is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Storing and reading files locally is straightforward.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be another user on the system, so some privileges are required (i.e., a user account).  
- Since the attacker is another user, not an administrator, this is **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required for the attack.  
- The attacker can read files once they have access.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The impact is limited to the same system and does not affect other components or security authorities.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Information disclosure is possible (web pages can be read by another user).  
- This is a **Low (L)** impact because the attacker gains some information but not complete system compromise.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification or tampering.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or disruption.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required (another user on the system) |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward attack |
| PR     | L     | Requires low privileges (another user account) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to same system |
| C      | L     | Information disclosure of stored web pages |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:N = 0.00
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78) = 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(1.41 + 1.82) = round_up(3.23) = 3.2

#####839#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Multiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved input validation. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13.4, iOS 16.5 and iPadOS 16.5. Multiple issues in libxml2."

---

### Step 1: Analyze the vulnerability context

- **Type of vulnerability:** Memory corruption issues (likely buffer overflows or similar).
- **Impact:** Memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption.
- **Affected component:** libxml2, a widely used XML parsing library.
- **Attack vector:** Since libxml2 is a library used for parsing XML, it is typically invoked by applications that process XML data. The attack likely involves supplying crafted XML data to an application using libxml2.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since the vulnerability is in a library that processes input data (XML), the attacker must supply crafted XML data. This can be done remotely if the application processes XML from network sources.  
- Typically, such vulnerabilities are considered **Network (N)** because the attacker can exploit it by sending crafted data over a network.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description mentions "multiple memory corruption issues" fixed by improved input validation, implying the attack does not require special conditions or timing.  
- Usually, memory corruption vulnerabilities in parsing libraries have **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges to supply crafted XML data to the vulnerable application.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted XML data to the application. No user interaction is needed beyond the attacker sending the data.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Memory corruption in a library can lead to code execution or impact other components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Usually, such vulnerabilities cause a **Changed (C)** scope because the impact crosses privilege boundaries or affects other components.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to information disclosure.  
- Since the description does not specify full disclosure but multiple memory corruption issues, assume **High (H)** impact on confidentiality (worst case).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **High (H)**.

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact (Changed Scope) = 7.52 * [1 - (1-C) * (1-I) * (1-A)]**  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1-0.56)*(1-0.56)*(1-0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.44*0.44*0.44]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score =**  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (6.88 + 4.37), 10))

#####840#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: 3D FlipBook plugin for WordPress
- Attack vector: Injection via a field in the plugin, executed when a user accesses the injected page
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above
- Impact: Execution of arbitrary web scripts when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely by submitting data to the plugin (via the ‘Ready Function’ field).  
- The attacker must be authenticated but can perform the attack over the network (e.g., via the web interface).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher.  
- Contributor-level is a low privilege but not none.  
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires a user to access the injected page for the script to execute.  
- So, user interaction is required (the victim must view the page).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the plugin and the WordPress site, but the impact is limited to the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim user (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality (not High, since it depends on victim interaction and context).  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that may modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a Low impact on integrity (not High, since the attacker cannot directly modify server data or code).  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: Low (L)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: Low (L)  
- I: Low (L)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.04

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.04) = round_up(4.55) = 4.6

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 1.22

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.22, 10))  
= round_up(4.81) = 4.8 (rounded to 4.8)

According to CVSS v3.1 scoring, scores are rounded to one decimal place.

  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via GraphQL endpoints, which are typically accessible over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description suggests a lack of authentication, meaning no special conditions or environment configurations are needed. This implies low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote attackers" with no mention of needing any privileges. The vulnerability is due to lack of authentication, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is mentioned or implied.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information within the same component (the package). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can obtain sensitive information. This is a clear confidentiality impact. Since the description says "obtain sensitive information," this is at least Low, possibly High. However, since it is not described as full disclosure of all data, Low is more appropriate.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modification or tampering with data.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of denial of service or impact on availability.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= Roundup(Min(1.41 + 3.91, 10)) = Roundup(5.32) = 5.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"File Upload vulnerability index.php in Pichome v.1.1.01 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via crafted POST request."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted POST request, which is sent over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No special conditions or environment requirements are mentioned; the attacker just needs to send a crafted POST request.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote" and no mention of needing any privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of needing user interaction; the attacker sends a crafted POST request directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which likely affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**

#####844#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Memory corruption when AP includes TID to link mapping IE in the beacons and STA is parsing the beacon TID to link mapping IE."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Memory corruption**: This usually implies a potential for code execution, crash, or data corruption.
- **Trigger condition**: When an Access Point (AP) includes a specific Information Element (IE) in beacon frames, and a Station (STA) parses it.
- **Attack vector**: The attacker controls the AP or can inject beacon frames.
- **Impact**: Likely affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to memory corruption.
- **User interaction**: The STA automatically parses beacon frames, so no user interaction is needed.
- **Privileges required**: The attacker only needs to be able to send beacon frames, which is typically possible without authentication or privileges.
- **Scope**: The vulnerability affects the STA parsing the beacon. The AP is the attacker. The impact is on the STA's memory. The scope likely remains unchanged because the vulnerable component and impacted component are the same (STA).

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker sends malicious beacon frames over the air. This is a **Network (N)** vector.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack requires the AP to include a crafted IE in beacon frames. This is straightforward and does not require special conditions. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the STA. They only need to send beacon frames, which is possible without authentication. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The STA automatically parses beacon frames without user interaction. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the STA's memory when parsing the beacon. The component impacted is the same as the vulnerable component (STA). So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Memory corruption could lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage. So, **Low (L)** is reasonable.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Memory corruption could allow modification of data or code execution. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service. So, **High (H)**.

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.45 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(9.36) = 9.4

#####845#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### Summary of the vulnerability:

- The issue is a **stack out-of-bounds (OOB) read** in the Linux kernel's network packet fragmentation code (`sch_frag` and `ip_do_fragment`).
- It occurs when fragmenting IPv4 packets that were previously reassembled.
- The vulnerability leads to a **read of size 1** from an invalid stack address.
- The bug can cause kernel crashes or memory corruption detection (KASAN reports).
- The attack vector involves sending specially crafted IPv4 packets.
- The vulnerability is in the kernel networking stack, triggered by network packet processing.
- The attacker can trigger this remotely by sending packets.
- No indication that user interaction is required.
- The vulnerability is a read (not write), so impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability must be considered carefully.
- The scope is likely **unchanged** because the vulnerability affects the kernel component itself, no privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component is described.
- Privileges required: None, since the attacker can send crafted packets to trigger the bug.
- User interaction: None, the attacker just sends packets.
- Impact: The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to information disclosure or crash (denial of service). The description mentions KASAN detecting bad access, which is a debugging tool, but in production, this could cause kernel panic or crash.
- Confidentiality impact: Possibly Low (some information leak via OOB read).
- Integrity impact: None (no write or modification).
- Availability impact: Low (possible crash or denial of service).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The Voting Record WordPress plugin through 2.0 is missing sanitisation as well as escaping, which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber to perform Stored XSS attacks.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Affected component:** WordPress plugin
- **Attackers:** Any authenticated user, including low-privilege users like subscribers
- **Impact:** Stored XSS can lead to execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.
- **Attack vector:** Since this is a web plugin, the attack is likely performed over the network.
- **Privileges required:** Authenticated user, but low privileges (subscriber)
- **User interaction:** The attacker stores malicious script, victim must view the stored content for the script to execute, so user interaction is required (victim must load the page)
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the plugin and the impact is on the user’s browser, which is outside the vulnerable component's security scope, so scope is likely Changed.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network (web).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  No special conditions or complex steps are required beyond being authenticated.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)  
  The attacker must be an authenticated user with low privileges (subscriber).

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must view the malicious content for the XSS to execute.

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)  
  The vulnerability affects the plugin, but the impact crosses to the user's browser, outside the vulnerable component's security scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  XSS can lead to theft of cookies or other data, but not full system compromise.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  XSS can allow modification of displayed content or actions on behalf of the user.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  XSS typically does not impact availability.

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Explaining PR value:**  
For Scope Changed, PR:L = 0.62 (from CVSS v3.1 specification)

---

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62 ≈ 2.06

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

- Impact = 7.52 × (Impact Subscore - 0.029) - 3.25 × (Impact Subscore - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.3916 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.3916 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.3626 - 3.25 × (0.3716)^15  
= 2.73 - negligible (since (0.3716)^15 is very small)  
≈ 2.73

- Base Score = If Impact ≤ 0, then 0, else:  
If Scope Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × (2.73 + 2.06), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × 4.79, 10))

#####847#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A flaw was found in indent, a program for formatting C code. This issue may allow an attacker to trick a user into processing a specially crafted file to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, causing the application to crash.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker must trick a user into processing a specially crafted file. The attack requires the user to open or process the file locally. This implies the attacker cannot exploit it remotely over the network without user involvement.  
  Since the attacker needs the user to open the file, the attack is local to the user's environment.  
  **AV = Local (L)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to create a specially crafted file, but no additional conditions or environment requirements are mentioned. Creating a crafted file is straightforward for an attacker with knowledge of the vulnerability.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker only needs to trick a user into opening the file. No mention of needing any privileges on the system.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must be tricked into processing the file, so user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes the application to crash due to a heap-based buffer overflow. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (indent program).  
  The impact is limited to the application itself, so the scope is unchanged.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description only mentions a crash (availability impact). No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The application crashes due to the heap-based buffer overflow, which impacts availability. The crash is a denial of service to the application.  
  Since the application crashes, this is a **Low (L)** or **High (H)** impact depending on the severity. Usually, a crash of a single application is Low impact on availability.  
  **A = Low (L)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local, user must open file |
| AC     | L     | Crafting file is straightforward |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must open/process file |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to application |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Application crash causes availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(3.24)  
= 3.2

- Vulnerability: SQL Injection via manipulation of the argument "ancestors"
- Affected component: unknown function in /system/dept/edit
- Attack Vector: "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- No version details available
- Classified as critical

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- Remote attacks typically correspond to Network (N).  
- **AV:N**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection via argument manipulation is usually straightforward if input is not sanitized.  
- No mention of special conditions or complex steps.  
- **AC:L** (Low complexity)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.  
- SQL Injection typically requires no privileges if the vulnerable input is accessible publicly.  
- **PR:N** (None)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely; no mention of needing a user to perform any action.  
- SQL Injection usually does not require user interaction.  
- **UI:N** (None)

**Scope (S):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to data leakage or modification within the same security scope (database).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **S:U** (Unchanged)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized data disclosure.  
- Since it is classified as critical, likely high impact on confidentiality.  
- **C:H** (High)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow data modification or deletion.  
- Likely high impact on integrity.  
- **I:H** (High)

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but no explicit mention here.  
- Given critical classification, availability impact could be high or low.  
- Since no explicit mention, but critical rating suggests significant impact, assume **A:H** (High)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 3.97, 10))  
= round_up(9.84) = 9.8

Rounded to one decimal place, the base score is **9.8**, which is in the Critical range.

- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the argument "Content"
- Input example: `</title><scRipt>alert(x)</scRipt>`
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is initiated remotely.
- The vulnerability is in a web portal, so the attacker can send crafted input over the network.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack involves injecting a script via an input argument.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- The description does not mention any complex conditions.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker manipulates an input argument.
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have any privileges.
- Usually, reflected or stored XSS can be exploited without privileges.
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**

- XSS requires the victim user to visit a crafted page or view the injected content.
- The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without the victim's interaction.
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is in a web application component.
- XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**

- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the victim user.
- Usually, XSS is considered to have Low impact on confidentiality because it can steal cookies, session tokens, or other data accessible to the victim.
- Therefore, C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**

- XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts in the victim's browser, potentially modifying data or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- This is considered a Low impact on integrity.
- Therefore, I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**

- XSS generally does not affect availability.
- No indication that the vulnerability causes denial of service.
- Therefore, A = None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.51 + 2.25)  
= Round_up (4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####850#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Nullptr dereference in paddle.crop in PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0. This flaw can cause a runtime crash and a denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in PaddlePaddle, a machine learning framework. Typically, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the software processes inputs from network sources. Since the description does not specify local access or physical access, and PaddlePaddle is often used in networked environments, we assume **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Null pointer dereference leading to a crash is usually straightforward to trigger if the attacker can supply crafted input. No special conditions or timing are mentioned. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention needing any privileges to exploit. Usually, denial of service via input processing can be done without privileges. So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The flaw is triggered by input to the software, no mention of requiring user interaction. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a runtime crash and denial of service in the same component (paddle.crop). No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries or affects other components. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The flaw causes a denial of service, no mention of data leakage. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or corruption. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of service affects availability. The description says "runtime crash and denial of service," so **High (H)** impact on availability.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | Simple to trigger |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service causes high availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.47) = 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Azure IPAM is a service with **read-only** access (Reader role) to Azure environments.
- The vulnerability is due to **lack of validation of the authentication token**, allowing an attacker to **impersonate any privileged user**.
- This leads to **accessing data stored within the IPAM instance and Azure**, causing **elevation of privilege**.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 3.0.0.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The attack involves passing an authentication token to the Azure IPAM service.
- Since Azure IPAM is a cloud service, the attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The vulnerability is due to lack of token validation, which is a straightforward flaw.
- No special conditions or environment constraints are mentioned.
- **AC = Low (L)**

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- The attacker can impersonate any privileged user by exploiting the token validation flaw.
- The description implies the attacker does **not** need any privileges beforehand to exploit this.
- **PR = None (N)**

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The attacker exploits the token validation flaw directly.
- No mention of needing a user to perform any action.
- **UI = None (N)**

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability allows access to data stored within the IPAM instance **and subsequently from Azure**.
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries from the IPAM service to Azure resources.
- Therefore, **Scope is Changed (C)**.

#### Confidentiality (C)
- The attacker can access data stored within IPAM and Azure.
- This is a significant confidentiality impact.
- **C = High (H)**

#### Integrity (I)
- The attacker can impersonate privileged users, which implies the ability to modify data or perform actions with elevated privileges.
- This is a high integrity impact.
- **I = High (H)**

#### Availability (A)

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | Simple token validation flaw |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to exploit |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security boundaries (IPAM to Azure) |

| I      | H     | Full integrity compromise via impersonation |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.476 ≈ 3.91

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 1)  
  = 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.8064 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.8064 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.7774 - 3.25 × (0.7864)^15  
  ≈ 5.85 - 3.25 × 0.041  
  ≈ 5.85 - 0.13 = 5.72

- Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
  = Roundup(Min(5.72 + 3.91, 10))  
  = Roundup(9.63) = 9.6 → 9.6 rounds to 9.6 (CVSS scores are typically rounded to one decimal place)

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact Subscore (S:U) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

#####853#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
TOTOLINK A3300R V17.0.0cu.557_B20221024 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the enable parameter in the setMacFilterRules function.

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is a command injection via a function parameter. Usually, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the function is accessible over the network (e.g., via a web interface or API). Since no indication suggests local or physical access is required, and TOTOLINK routers typically have web interfaces accessible over the network, we assume **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Command injection via a parameter usually requires low complexity if no special conditions are needed. The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The vulnerability is in the `setMacFilterRules` function, which might be part of the router's management interface. If the attacker needs to be authenticated to access this function, PR would be Low or High. If no authentication is required, PR is None. The description does not specify authentication requirements. However, command injection vulnerabilities in router management interfaces often require authentication. Without explicit info, the conservative assumption is **Low (L)** privileges required.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Command injection vulnerabilities typically do not require user interaction if the attacker can send crafted requests directly. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  Command injection usually allows the attacker to execute commands on the underlying OS, which is outside the scope of the vulnerable component (the application). This means the scope is **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Command injection can lead to full system compromise, including reading sensitive data. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Command injection allows modification of system files or settings. So, **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Command injection can disrupt system availability (e.g., by deleting files or stopping services). So, **High (H)**.

| Integrity (I)        | H     | Full system compromise possible                                           |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

Since Scope is Changed:  
Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.886 - 3.25 * (0.895)^15  
= 6.66 - 3.25 * 0.166  
= 6.66 - 0.54 = 6.12

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(6.12 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(8.80) = 8.8 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
"When a user scans a QR Code with the QR Code Scanner feature, the user is not prompted before being navigated to the page specified in the code. This may surprise the user and potentially direct them to unwanted content."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack requires the user to scan a QR code, which can be done remotely (e.g., scanning a QR code from a poster, website, or other media).  
- The attacker can place the QR code in a location accessible to the user without physical access to the device.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires the user to scan a QR code, which is straightforward and does not require special conditions or complex steps.  
- No special environment or conditions are needed.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The user does not need any privileges on the device to be affected; scanning a QR code is a normal user action.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must scan the QR code, which is an action initiated by the user.  
- However, the vulnerability is that the user is **not prompted** before navigation, so the user interaction is scanning the QR code itself.  
- Since the user must perform an action (scanning), **User Interaction is Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes navigation to an unwanted page but does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component (the QR code scanner app or browser).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects other components or privileges outside the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability may direct the user to unwanted content but does not indicate any data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data or code.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects availability.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: Required (R)  
- S: Unchanged (U)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: None (N)  
- A: None (N)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)) = 0

Since Impact = 0, Base Score = Exploitability = 2.7 (rounded)

#####855#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Totolink N200RE 9.3.5u.6139_B20201216
- Affects function `setDiagnosisCfg` in `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`
- Manipulation of the argument `ip` leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow**
- Attack can be initiated **remotely**
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Classified as **critical**

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely, and the vulnerable function is accessible via a CGI script (web interface).  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument (`ip`).  
- No mention of special conditions or environment requirements.  
- Usually, buffer overflow via input manipulation with no special conditions is low complexity.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely via the CGI interface.  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Likely no privileges required.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the CGI script.  
- No mention that a user must perform any action for the exploit to succeed.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in a web application component.  
- Usually, buffer overflows in the same component affect the same security scope (same privileges).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but buffer overflows often can lead to information disclosure.  
- Since it is critical and stack-based buffer overflow, it is reasonable to assume at least some confidentiality impact (e.g., attacker can read sensitive data or gain unauthorized access).  
- Assign **C:H (High)** to reflect critical impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow arbitrary code execution or modification of data.  
- This implies a high integrity impact.  
- **I:H (High)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- This implies high availability impact.  
- **A:H (High)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via CGI script |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, straightforward buffer overflow |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | H     | Critical impact, likely full data disclosure |
| I      | H     | Full integrity compromise possible |
| A      | H     | Denial of service or crash possible |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.475 ≈ 3.90

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 6.42 × 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
= Roundup(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(5.87 + 3.90)  
= Roundup(9.77) = 9.8

#####856#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A heap use-after-free issue in SQLite's jsonParseAddNodeArray() function allows a local attacker to leverage a victim to pass specially crafted malicious input, potentially causing a crash and denial of service.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is local (not remote network) because it says "local attacker" and "leverage a victim" (likely local user interaction).  
- So, AV = Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must "leverage a victim" to pass malicious input, implying some conditions or user involvement.  
- This suggests the attack complexity is not trivial but not very complex either. However, since user interaction is required, and the attacker must trick a victim, AC is likely High (H).  
- But AC is about conditions beyond attacker control. Since the attacker must rely on a victim to provide input, this is a condition outside the attacker's control, so AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is local but does not necessarily need privileges on the system; the attacker leverages a victim to pass input.  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- So, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must "leverage a victim" to pass malicious input, so user interaction is required.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash and denial of service in the same component (SQLite).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention any data disclosure.  
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability can cause a crash and denial of service.  
- This impacts availability.  
- Severity is not specified, but denial of service is usually Low or High depending on impact.  
- Since it causes a crash and DoS, Availability impact = High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV: L (Local)  
- AC: H (High)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: N (None)  
- I: N (None)  
- A: H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with these values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:H = 0.44  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.1279 ≈ 1.05

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 1.05, 10))  
= round_up(4.6452)  
= 4.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

---

### Final result:

- AV:L  
- AC:H  
- PR:N  
- UI:R  
- S:U  
- C:N  
- I:N  
- A:H

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values to each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in StanfordVL GibsonEnv 0.3.1, specifically in `cloudpickle.load` function.
- The vulnerability leads to deserialization.
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Attack complexity is high (exploitability is difficult).
- Exploit has been publicly disclosed.
- Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metric Values

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."  
- Remote attacks correspond to **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- "The complexity of an attack is rather high."  
- This means **High (H)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention of needing privileges.  
- Since the attack is remote and no privileges are mentioned, assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities often do not require user interaction if the attacker can send data directly.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- No mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities often lead to code execution within the same scope.  
- Assume **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Deserialization can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can lead to full data disclosure.  
- Classified as critical, so likely **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can modify data.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can disrupt availability.  
- So, **High (H)**.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Youke365 up to 1.5.3
- Affects /app/api/controller/collect.php
- Manipulation of the argument "url" leads to server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Attack can be launched remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely. SSRF typically involves sending a crafted request over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SSRF vulnerabilities usually require the attacker to control or manipulate a URL parameter.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges.  
- SSRF is often exploitable without authentication.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted request directly; no user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- SSRF vulnerabilities often allow the attacker to make requests from the vulnerable server to other internal or external resources.  
- This can lead to impact beyond the vulnerable component, potentially affecting other components or systems.  
- The description does not explicitly say the scope changes, but SSRF typically changes scope because the impact crosses trust boundaries.  
- Therefore, S = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SSRF can lead to disclosure of internal resources or sensitive information.  
- The description does not specify the exact impact, but SSRF is often used to read internal data.  
- Given the critical classification, assume at least Low confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SSRF generally does not allow modification of data, but sometimes it can be used to trigger actions.  
- The description does not mention integrity impact.  
- Therefore, I = None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- SSRF can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but no such impact is mentioned.  
- Therefore, A = None (N)

#####859#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Leanote version 2.7.0 allows obtaining arbitrary local files. This is possible because the application is vulnerable to LFR (Local File Read).

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Local File Read (LFR) vulnerability.
- **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary local files.
- **Version:** Leanote 2.7.0.
- **Attack Vector:** Since it involves reading local files, the attacker likely needs to interact with the application remotely or locally.
- The description does not specify if the attacker needs to be local or remote, but since Leanote is a web application, and LFR usually can be exploited remotely via crafted requests, we can assume **Network** as the attack vector.
- No mention of authentication or privileges required.
- No mention of user interaction.
- Impact is on confidentiality (reading files), no mention of integrity or availability impact.
- Scope likely unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security scope).

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  Since Leanote is a web application and the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network, AV = **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. LFR vulnerabilities are usually straightforward if the input is not sanitized. So AC = **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description does not mention needing to be authenticated or have any privileges. So PR = **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention that the attacker needs another user to perform any action. So UI = **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows reading local files but does not affect other components or security domains. So Scope = **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary local file read impacts confidentiality. The attacker can read sensitive files. This is a **High (H)** impact.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of modification of files or data. So Integrity = **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of denial of service or availability impact. So Availability = **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value  | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N      | Remote network attack possible                  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L      | No special conditions required                   |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N    | No privileges required                           |
| User Interaction (UI)| N       | No user interaction required                     |
| Scope (S)            | U       | Vulnerability affects the same security scope   |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H       | Arbitrary file read impacts confidentiality      |
| Integrity (I)        | N       | No integrity impact                               |
| Availability (A)     | N       | No availability impact                            |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Base Score calculation:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
  = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556  
  ≈ 8.22 * 0.472  
  ≈ 3.88

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 * 1 * 1]  
  = 1 - 0.44  
  = 0.56

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
  = 6.42 * 0.56  
  = 3.5952

- Base Score = Round up to one decimal place:  
  Since Scope is Unchanged:  
  Base Score = min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
  = min(3.5952 + 3.88, 10)  
  = 7.4752 → 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Poikosoft EZ CD Audio Converter 8.0.7, specifically in the Activation Handler component.
- The attack involves manipulation of the argument "Key" leading to denial of service.
- Local access is required to perform the attack.
- The exploit is publicly disclosed.
- The impact is denial of service (availability impact).

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "Local access is required" → AV:L (Local)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity; manipulation of an argument suggests straightforward exploitation.  
- Assume AC:L (Low)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- "Local access is required" but no mention of needing privileges beyond local user.  
- Since it requires local access but no mention of elevated privileges, assume PR:L (Low)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required for the attack.  
- Assume UI:N (None)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects a component within the same software, no indication that the impact crosses security boundaries.  
- Assume S:U (Unchanged)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of confidentiality impact.  
- C:N (None)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of integrity impact.  
- I:N (None)

**Availability (A):**  
- The attack leads to denial of service → impact on availability.  
- The severity is not explicitly stated, but denial of service usually corresponds to at least Low or High.  
- Since the description says "denial of service" without further detail, assume A:L (Low) or A:H (High).  
- Given the exploit is public and the impact is denial of service, and no mention of complete service outage, assume A:L (Low).

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:L (Low)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78) = 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.82, 10)) = round_up(3.23) = 3.2 → 3.2 rounds to 3.2 (CVSS scores are rounded to one decimal place)

#####861#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The Linux kernel io_uring IORING_OP_SOCKET operation contained a double free in function __sys_socket_file() in file net/socket.c.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Vulnerability type:** Double free in kernel code.
- **Component:** Linux kernel, specifically io_uring's socket operation.
- **Impact:** Double free can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing system crashes or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vector:** Since this is a kernel vulnerability related to a socket operation, it is likely exploitable remotely via network socket calls.
- **Privileges required:** The function is `__sys_socket_file()`, which is a syscall interface. Usually, socket syscalls can be invoked by unprivileged users, but some socket operations may require certain privileges.
- **User interaction:** Not required, as this is a kernel syscall.
- **Scope:** The vulnerability is in the kernel, so if exploited, it can affect the kernel's integrity and availability, possibly changing scope.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Double free can cause memory corruption, potentially leading to denial of service (availability impact) and possibly privilege escalation (integrity impact). Confidentiality impact is less likely unless the corruption leads to info leak.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 base metric values

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a socket operation, which is accessible over the network.  
  **AV:N (Network)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Double free vulnerabilities in kernel code are usually straightforward to exploit once the attacker can invoke the vulnerable syscall. No special conditions or race conditions mentioned.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The syscall is `__sys_socket_file()`. Creating sockets usually requires no special privileges (unprivileged users can create sockets). So, no privileges required.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No user interaction required; the attacker can invoke the syscall directly.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the kernel, and exploitation can lead to memory corruption affecting kernel integrity and availability. This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S:C (Changed)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Double free typically does not directly leak information. No mention of info leak.  
  **C:N (None)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Memory corruption in kernel can lead to privilege escalation or code execution, which is a high integrity impact.  
  **I:H (High)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  Double free can cause system crashes or denial of service.  
  **A:H (High)**

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Formula for Scope Changed:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85 ≈ 3.91

- Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - 1 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
  = 7.52 × [1 - 0.1936]  
  = 7.52 × 0.8064 ≈ 6.06

- Base Score =  
  If Impact ≤ 0, then 0, else:  
  If Scope Changed:  
  BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 × (6.06 + 3.91), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 × 9.97, 10))  
  = round_up(min(10.76, 10))  
  = round_up(10) = 10.0

---

### Final summary:

- AV: Network (N)  
- AC: Low (L)  
- PR: None (N)  
- UI: None (N)  
- S: Changed (C)  
- C: None (N)  
- I: High (H)  
- A: High (H)

#####862#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: WikiDiscover extension in CreateWiki managed farm
- Exploitation requires: `(editinterface)` right (a specific permission)
- Attack vector: On-wiki (web interface)
- Impact: Injection of unescaped interface messages leading to XSS
- No user interaction mentioned beyond the attacker having the required privilege
- Scope: Not explicitly stated as changed, likely unchanged
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: XSS typically impacts confidentiality and integrity by allowing script execution in victim's browser; availability impact is usually none or low.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via the web interface (on-wiki).  
- The attacker must have `(editinterface)` rights, so the attacker must be authenticated and have specific privileges.  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (web).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires the attacker to have `(editinterface)` rights, which is a specific privilege, but no other complex conditions are mentioned.  
- The attack itself is straightforward once privileges are obtained.  
- AC is Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have `(editinterface)` rights. This is a specific permission, so not None.  
- Is this Low or High?  
- `(editinterface)` is a specific right, likely a low-level privilege (not admin/root).  
- According to CVSS v3.1, Low privileges mean some privileges are required but not administrative or high-level.  
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by performing actions on the wiki (with the required rights).  
- No mention of victim user interaction required for the attack to succeed.  
- The attacker is the one with privileges, so no victim user interaction is needed.  
- UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (the wiki extension).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens) in the victim's browser.  
- This is a Low impact on confidentiality (not High, since it does not directly leak data from the server).  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow script injection, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a Low impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N)

### Summary of Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack via web interface |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions beyond privileges |
| PR     | L     | Requires `(editinterface)` rights (low privileges) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | XSS leads to low confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | XSS leads to low integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N`

---

### Optional: Calculate Base Score (for completeness)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope=Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

Calculate Impact:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
= 2.515

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.274  
= approx 2.25

Base Score = Roundup(Min((Impact Subscore + Exploitability), 10))  
= Roundup(2.515 + 2.25)  
= Roundup(4.765)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####863#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in GTKWave 3.3.115.
- Triggered by opening a specially crafted `.vzt` file.
- Leads to memory corruption.
- The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious file.  
- The attacker must deliver a file to the victim, who then opens it locally.  
- This implies **Local (L)**, since the attack requires local access to open the file.  
- It is not network-based because the attacker cannot exploit it remotely without user action.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted file.  
- No indication of complex conditions or environment needed beyond opening the file.  
- This suggests **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The victim just needs to open the file; no mention of needing elevated privileges.  
- The attacker does not require any privileges on the victim system.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to memory corruption within GTKWave.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Memory corruption could lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage.  
- Integer overflow leading to memory corruption often can cause crashes or code execution but not necessarily confidentiality loss.  
- Given no explicit mention, assign **Low (L)** to reflect potential limited confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Memory corruption can lead to modification of data or code.  
- This suggests at least **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory corruption can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **Low (L)** availability impact.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Requires local file opening.                                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions beyond opening file.                               |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed.                                                     |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must open the malicious file.                                       |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to vulnerable component.                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible limited info disclosure due to memory corruption.               |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible data/code modification due to memory corruption.                |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Possible crash or denial of service.                                     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 × 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.83 + 3.38) = Round_up (5.21) = 5.2

#####864#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Sparksuite SimpleMDE up to 1.11.2.
- Affects iFrame Handler component.
- Leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- No explicit mention of required privileges or user interaction.
- No explicit mention of scope change.
- Impact is on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is not clearly stated.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to initiate the attack remotely."  
- XSS is typically exploitable over the network (e.g., via a web browser).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS usually has low complexity if the attacker can inject scripts.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that attacker needs any privileges.  
- XSS usually requires no privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS typically requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).  
- The description does not explicitly say "no user interaction."  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS usually affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually considered Low impact on confidentiality unless explicitly stated.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow attacker to inject scripts, potentially modifying data or actions.  
- Usually Low impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

| Scope (S)            | U      | No scope change indicated.                       |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Some info disclosure possible.                   |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Some data modification possible.                 |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact.                          |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.84) = Roundup(5.35) = 5.4

  The attacker runs arbitrary code via a web parameter, implying no prior privileges are needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS usually requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page) for the script to execute. The description does not specify that the attacker can exploit it without user interaction.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows running arbitrary code, but it is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, which typically affects the same security scope (the web application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). Since it allows arbitrary code execution in the context of the user, confidentiality impact is likely Low or High. However, since it is not explicitly stated that it leads to full data disclosure, we assign Low (L).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution via XSS can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, so integrity is impacted.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability directly. No mention of DoS or availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(5.35)  
= 5.4

#####867#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel ixgbe driver.
- NULL pointer dereference occurs during the ethtool loopback test.
- The issue arises because no q_vector is associated with the test ring (interrupts not normally added).
- The fix adds a check for q_vector before returning napi_id.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability occurs during the ethtool loopback test, which is typically run locally on the machine by an administrator or user with access to the system.  
- This is not exploitable remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is a NULL pointer dereference triggered by running a specific ethtool loopback test.  
- The test must be run intentionally, but no special conditions or race conditions are mentioned.  
- The complexity is low because the test is a standard operation and the bug is straightforward.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Running ethtool loopback test usually requires elevated privileges (root or equivalent) because it interacts with network driver internals.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by running the ethtool loopback test, which is a user-initiated action.  
- No other user interaction is required beyond the attacker running the test.  
- Since the attacker must perform the action themselves, no additional user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a NULL pointer dereference in the kernel driver, which likely leads to a kernel crash or denial of service.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (kernel).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or privileges beyond the kernel driver.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- NULL pointer dereference leads to denial of service, no indication of data disclosure.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data integrity is affected.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- NULL pointer dereference likely causes a crash or denial of service.  
- Therefore, **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local execution required to run ethtool test |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward test |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges to run ethtool test |
| UI     | N     | No additional user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to kernel driver, no scope change |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Denial of service due to NULL pointer dereference |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [since Scope=Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI**  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(4.38) = 4.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####868#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Null pointer dereference while parsing specially crafted CGM files.  
- Impact: Causes application crash leading to denial of service (DoS).  
- Affected software: JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization versions prior to specified patches.  
- Attack vector: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing specially crafted files (CGM files).  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing specially crafted files.  
- The files are likely received or opened locally or via network.  
- Since the files are CGM files, which are typically opened by the user, and the attacker must provide a malicious file.  
- If the file is received over the network or via email, the attack vector could be Network.  
- However, since the user must open the file, the attack vector is likely **Local (L)** or **Adjacent (A)**.  
- Adjacent is typically for attacks from the same network segment (e.g., Bluetooth, local network).  
- Since the file must be opened by the user, and the attacker must deliver the file, the vector is **Local (L)**.  

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted CGM files.  
- No mention of any special conditions or timing.  
- Crafting a malicious CGM file is likely straightforward for an attacker.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.  

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must provide a malicious file to be opened by the user.  
- No mention that the attacker needs any privileges on the system.  
- The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any privileges.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.  

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must open the specially crafted CGM file.  
- This requires user interaction.  
- Therefore, **Required (R)**.  

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes the application to crash (denial of service).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.  

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash, no mention of data disclosure.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.  

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash, no mention of data modification.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.  

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability causes denial of service (application crash).  
- This impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely **High (H)** because the application crashes.  

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Requires local file to be opened |
| AC     | L     | Crafting malicious file is straightforward |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must open the file |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Application crash causes high availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:H (0.56)  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83  

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.59  

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.42)  
= 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####869#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerable plugin: OMGF | GDPR/DSGVO Compliant, Faster Google Fonts. Easy. for WordPress.
- Vulnerability: Unauthorized modification of data and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Cause: Missing capability check on update_settings() function hooked via admin_init.
- Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can update plugin settings, inject XSS payloads, and delete entire directories.
- Versions affected: Up to and including 5.7.9.
- Attack vector: Remote (via WordPress admin_init hook).
- Attacker: Unauthenticated (no privileges required).
- User interaction: Not explicitly mentioned, but since the attack is via admin_init hook and unauthenticated attacker can exploit it, likely no user interaction required.
- Scope: The vulnerability allows modification of plugin settings and deletion of directories, which may affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed remotely over the network (via WordPress hooks).
- So, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check, which is straightforward to exploit.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- So, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning no privileges required.
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker exploits the vulnerability directly; no user interaction is required.
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows modification of plugin settings and deletion of directories.
- Deleting directories may affect resources beyond the vulnerable component (plugin).
- This suggests the scope is Changed (C).
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The description does not mention data disclosure.
- The main impact is unauthorized modification and XSS.
- XSS can lead to data theft, but the description focuses on unauthorized modification and directory deletion.
- Since XSS is stored and can be used to steal data, but the description does not explicitly mention confidentiality impact, we consider Low (L) for confidentiality.
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- Unauthorized modification of plugin settings and injection of XSS payloads.
- This clearly impacts integrity.
- The impact is significant but not complete destruction of integrity.
- So, Integrity = High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- The attacker can delete entire directories.
- This can cause denial of service or loss of availability.
- So, Availability = High (H).

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploit, no special conditions                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Unauthenticated attacker                                                                  |

### Step 3: Construct CVSS v3.1 vector string

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

---

### Step 4: Calculate Base Score (using CVSS v3.1 calculator logic)

Using the CVSS v3.1 formula or an online calculator:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:L = 0.22
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

Calculate Impact:

Impact = 7.52 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]

= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]

= 7.52 * [1 - (0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)]

= 7.52 * [1 - 0.151]

= 7.52 * 0.849

= 6.39

Calculate Exploitability:

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556

= 8.22 * 0.472

= 3.88

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

= Roundup (6.39 + 3.88) = Roundup (10.27) = 10.0 (max score)

---

### Final result:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)
- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)
- **Integrity (I):** High (H)
- **Availability (A):** High (H)

#####870#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affected software: EventON WordPress plugin (Pro ≤ 4.5.4, Free ≤ 2.2.7)
- Cause: Missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function that updates post metadata
- Impact: An unauthenticated attacker can update arbitrary post metadata by tricking a site administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link)
- Attacker: Unauthenticated (no privileges)
- User interaction: Required (the admin must be tricked into clicking a link)
- Scope: The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin data)
- Impact: Update of arbitrary post metadata (likely impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability to some extent)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network by tricking an admin to click a link.  
- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must trick an admin into clicking a link, but no other complex conditions are mentioned.  
- CSRF attacks generally have low complexity if the user can be tricked easily.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges required.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The admin must be tricked into clicking a link (user interaction required).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the plugin's data). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can update arbitrary post metadata. This may expose or alter data, but no direct data disclosure is mentioned.  
- Likely Low impact on confidentiality (some data may be exposed or indirectly affected).  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can update arbitrary post metadata, which is a direct integrity impact.  
- This is a clear integrity impact, but not complete control or destruction.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- No direct mention of availability impact, but arbitrary metadata updates could cause some disruption.  
- Likely Low impact on availability (e.g., corrupted metadata could cause minor disruption).  
- A = Low (L)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:L (Low)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:L = 0.22

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 1 - 0.474 ≈ 0.526

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(Min[3.38 + 2.68, 10])  
= Roundup(6.06) = 6.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An improper access control vulnerability in GitLab Remote Development allows an attacker to create a workspace in one group that is associated with an agent from another group.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves creating a workspace remotely in GitLab.  
- Since GitLab is a web-based platform, the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description suggests an improper access control, which typically means the attacker does not need special conditions or complex steps beyond exploiting the access control flaw.  
- No mention of complex conditions or timing.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can create a workspace in one group associated with an agent from another group.  
- This implies the attacker must have some level of access to GitLab (e.g., membership in a group) to create a workspace.  
- However, the description does not explicitly say the attacker is unauthenticated or has no privileges.  
- Since the attacker can create a workspace, they likely have at least low privileges (e.g., member of a group).  
- **PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is creating a workspace; no mention of requiring another user to perform any action.  
- The attacker acts directly.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows creating a workspace in one group associated with an agent from another group.  
- This crosses group boundaries, which are likely different security authorities within GitLab.  
- This suggests a change in scope because the impact crosses security boundaries (from one group to another).  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description does not mention data disclosure.  
- The attacker can create a workspace associated with an agent from another group, which may allow access to information or resources of that other group.  
- This implies some confidentiality impact, likely low.  
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can create a workspace associated with an agent from another group, which may allow modification or creation of resources improperly.  
- This suggests some integrity impact, likely low.  
- **I = Low (L)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of availability impact.  
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack possible via GitLab web interface |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | L     | Attacker likely needs low privileges (group membership) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses group boundaries (security scope change) |
| C      | L     | Possible low confidentiality impact due to cross-group access |
| I      | L     | Possible low integrity impact due to workspace creation |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 3.11

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 7.52 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.95

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= MIN(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10)  
= 1.08 * (2.95 + 3.11)  
= 1.08 * 6.06 ≈ 6.54

Rounded to one decimal place: **6.5**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"SQL Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability was found using an update statement in the SolarWinds Platform. This vulnerability requires user authentication to be exploited."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is a SQL Injection that can be exploited remotely (likely over the network). Since it's a platform vulnerability and involves remote exploitation, the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if no special conditions are required. The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states: "This vulnerability requires user authentication to be exploited."  
  This means the attacker must have some privileges (authenticated user). Since it requires user authentication but not necessarily administrative privileges, this corresponds to **Low (L)** privileges.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention that any user interaction is required for exploitation. Usually, SQL Injection can be exploited by the attacker directly sending crafted requests. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is a SQL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution. Usually, RCE implies that the impact crosses security boundaries (e.g., from the database to the underlying system or from one component to another).  
  Since it is a platform vulnerability and involves remote code execution, the scope is likely **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL Injection and RCE can lead to full data disclosure. So, **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Remote Code Execution allows full control, so **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  RCE can also lead to denial of service or system compromise, so **High (H)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Remote network exploitation                     |

### CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####873#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Product: Skyworth Router CM5100, version 4.1.1.24
- Vulnerability: Insufficient validation of user input for the IPsec Tunnel Name parameter at the web interface.
- Attack vector: Remote attacker supplies specially crafted input via the web interface.
- Impact: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via the web interface.  
- This means the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply specially crafted input; no special conditions or timing required.  
- This suggests low complexity.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and interacts with the web interface.  
- Usually, web interfaces are accessible without authentication for some parameters, but the description does not explicitly say if authentication is required.  
- Since it is a stored XSS via a parameter in the web interface, and the description does not mention authentication, assume **None (N)**.  
- If authentication was required, it would be Low or High. But no mention, so **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- Stored XSS requires a victim user to visit the page or trigger the malicious script.  
- The attacker stores the malicious payload, but for the impact to occur, a user must interact (e.g., visit the page).  
- Therefore, user interaction is **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- Stored XSS affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- It does not escalate privileges or affect other components.  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the web application.  
- This is a **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Stored XSS can modify or inject content, potentially altering displayed data or user interactions.  
- This is a **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- **Value: None (N)**

|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Remote attack via network (web interface)                                                 |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                                                            |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No authentication or privileges required                                                  |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | Victim user must interact (visit page) to trigger XSS                                     |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact limited to the same security scope                                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible disclosure of sensitive information (cookies, tokens)                            |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Possible modification of displayed content                                                |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.52 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.20) = 5.2

Rounded to one decimal place: 5.2

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score (Optional check)

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score =**  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = RoundUp(Min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= RoundUp(Min(1.08 * (6.88 + 3.91), 10))  
= RoundUp(Min(1.08 * 10.79, 10))

#####876#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A Race Condition discovered in geofence.cpp and mission_feasibility_checker.cpp in PX4 Autopilot 1.14 and earlier allows attackers to send drones on unintended missions.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Race Condition  
- **Affected software:** PX4 Autopilot 1.14 and earlier  
- **Impact:** Allows attackers to send drones on unintended missions (likely unauthorized control or manipulation of mission data)  
- **Attack vector:** Since PX4 Autopilot is drone control software, the attack likely happens remotely or via network communication to the autopilot system.  
- **Privileges:** The attacker can send commands to the drone, so likely no privileges or low privileges are required.  
- **User interaction:** Probably none, as the attacker sends commands directly to the autopilot.  
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the drone's mission control, which may be outside the original security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- **Impact:** Unauthorized mission control implies impact on confidentiality (possibly low), integrity (high, since mission data is altered), and availability (possibly low or none, since the drone is still operational but misdirected).

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends commands to the drone remotely. PX4 autopilot typically communicates over network interfaces (e.g., telemetry radios, Wi-Fi).  
- So, **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Race conditions often require precise timing, which can be difficult to exploit.  
- However, if the attacker can reliably send commands to trigger the race condition, complexity might be low.  
- Given the description, no mention of difficult conditions, so **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker sends commands to the drone to cause unintended missions.  
- If the attacker can send commands without authentication or with no privileges, PR = None.  
- If authentication is required, PR = Low or High.  
- The description does not mention authentication or privilege requirements.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends commands directly; no user interaction needed.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to send drones on unintended missions, which affects the drone's behavior beyond the vulnerable component.  
- This suggests the impact crosses security boundaries.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can cause unintended missions, but no mention of data disclosure.  
- Likely no confidentiality impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can alter the mission, which is a high integrity impact.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The drone is still operational but misdirected.  
- No indication of denial of service or loss of availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote network access to the autopilot                                    |

| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No data disclosure                                                        |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Mission data is altered, high integrity impact                           |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                                                    |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:N (0.0)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56  
= 4.21

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Shanxi Diankeyun Technology NODERP up to 6.0.2.
- Classified as critical.
- Affects unknown code in the file /runtime/log.
- Manipulation leads to files or directories being accessible.
- Attack can be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Vendor did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack can be initiated remotely."  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Most likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- The attack seems straightforward (manipulation leads to file/directory access).  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention needing any privileges.  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely and gain access to files/directories.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely and exploit it.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to files or directories being accessible.  
- The description does not mention a change in scope (e.g., from one component to another).  
- Usually, file access within the same component means **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- "Manipulation leads to files or directories accessible."  
- This implies some confidentiality impact.  
- Since it is classified as critical and files/directories are accessible, but the exact extent is unknown, assume **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification or tampering with data.  
- Only access is mentioned.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- So, **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Attack can be initiated remotely over the network.                        |

| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required.                                             |
| Scope (S)            | U     | No indication of scope change.                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Files/directories accessible, critical impact on confidentiality.         |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact mentioned.                                            |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact mentioned.                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact sub-score = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(3.5952 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(7.4852)  
= 7.5

#####878#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM PowerSC versions 1.3, 2.0, and 2.1 have a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to hijack the clicking action of a victim. The attacker must persuade the victim to visit a malicious website, which then exploits the vulnerability to hijack click actions and possibly launch further attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and persuades the victim to visit a malicious website.  
- This implies the attack is conducted over the network (Internet).  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must persuade the victim to visit a malicious website, which requires some social engineering but no special conditions or environment.  
- This is a typical user interaction scenario, not requiring complex conditions.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is remote and does not require any privileges on the victim's system.  
- The attack is performed by luring the victim to a malicious site.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The victim must visit a malicious website (user action required).  
- This is explicit user interaction.  
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows hijacking the victim's click actions and possibly launching further attacks against the victim.  
- The description suggests the impact is on the same security scope (the victim's user session or environment).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Hijacking click actions could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized access.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure but implies potential further attacks.  
- Given the hijacking of clicks, some confidentiality impact is likely (e.g., leaking information via clicks).  
- Assign **Low (L)** for confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Hijacking clicks can lead to unauthorized actions, modifying data or commands.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- Assign **Low (L)** for integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or impact on availability.  
- Assign **None (N)** for availability.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via malicious website |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, only user persuasion needed |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must visit malicious site |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Possible information disclosure via click hijack |
| I      | L     | Possible unauthorized modification via click hijack |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####879#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Buffer over-read vulnerability in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS through master branch 53a0d97 allows attackers obtain sensitive information via crafted input to dtls_ccm_decrypt_message().

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
The vulnerability is exploitable via crafted input to a function in tinyDTLS. Since DTLS is a network protocol (Datagram Transport Layer Security), the attacker can send crafted packets over the network.  
**Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements. The attacker just needs to send crafted input. This suggests low complexity.  
**Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker sends crafted input to the DTLS function, presumably without any authentication or privileges.  
**Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
No mention of user interaction required. The attacker can send crafted packets directly.  
**Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
The vulnerability allows reading sensitive information via buffer over-read. This is a memory disclosure within the same component (tinyDTLS). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes privileges.  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
The attacker can obtain sensitive information. This is a clear confidentiality impact. Since the attacker can read sensitive data, but no indication of complete system compromise, this is likely Low or High. Buffer over-read can sometimes lead to high confidentiality impact if critical secrets are leaked. Given the description "allows attackers obtain sensitive information," we assume **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
**Value:** None (N)

8. **Availability (A):**  
No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
**Value:** None (N)

| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                                                       |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact                                                    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.87, 10)) = round_up(7.46) = 7.5

#####880#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- An authenticated user can execute arbitrary commands as root by providing a payload in the "destination" field of network test tools.  
- The vulnerability is mitigated on the UI level by JavaScript blacklisting but can be exploited by sending POST requests directly.  
- This implies the attack is possible over the network (via POST requests).  
- The attacker must be authenticated (i.e., have some privileges).  
- The impact is command execution as root, so full system compromise is possible.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by sending POST requests over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending POST requests directly, bypassing UI blacklisting.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be an authenticated user.  
- The description says "authenticated user," so privileges are required but not necessarily high.  
- Since the attacker can execute commands as root, but must be authenticated first, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends POST requests directly; no user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker executes commands as root, which is a higher privilege than the initial user context.  
- This indicates a scope change (from user privileges to root privileges).  
- Therefore, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary command execution as root implies full confidentiality impact.  
- Therefore, C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary command execution as root implies full integrity impact.  
- Therefore, I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary command execution as root can disrupt or deny service.  
- Therefore, A = High (H).

#####881#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The Seed Social WordPress plugin before 2.0.4 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- **Type of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Attackers:** High privilege users such as admin
- **Impact:** Stored XSS can lead to execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of other users.
- **Privileges required:** High (admin level)
- **User interaction:** Not explicitly mentioned, but usually XSS payload execution requires victim user to visit a page or interact with the content.
- **Attack vector:** Since this is a WordPress plugin vulnerability, the attack is likely performed through the web interface (network accessible).
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the plugin and can impact other users (victims) in the system, so scope might be changed.
- **Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability:** XSS typically impacts confidentiality and integrity by stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of users. Availability impact is usually none or low.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed over the network (web interface).  
  **AV:N**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is due to lack of sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit for a high privilege user. No special conditions mentioned.  
  **AC:L**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be a high privilege user such as admin.  
  **PR:H**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  Stored XSS requires the victim user to view or interact with the malicious content for the payload to execute. So user interaction is required.  
  **UI:R**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows a high privilege user to perform XSS attacks that affect other users. This means the impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S:C**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens). Impact is significant but not total compromise.  
  **C:L**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow attacker to perform actions on behalf of other users, modifying data or settings.  
  **I:L**

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not impact availability.  
  **A:N**

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network attack vector via web interface |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, straightforward exploit |
| PR     | H     | Requires high privileges (admin) |
| UI     | R     | Requires victim user interaction to trigger XSS |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to impact on other users |
| C      | L     | Limited confidentiality impact (data disclosure) |
| I      | L     | Limited integrity impact (actions on behalf of users) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.97

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Subscore + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 3.97, 10))  
= round_up(9.15) = 9.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM Security Access Manager Container (versions 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.6.1) temporarily stores sensitive information in files that could be accessed by a local user.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires a local user to access files on the system. This is not exploitable remotely or over a network.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Accessing files locally is straightforward.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is a local user who can access the files. The description does not specify that elevated privileges are needed, so assume low privileges (a normal user).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention any need for user interaction (e.g., clicking a link). The attacker is a local user accessing files directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the local system). There is no indication that a different security authority or component is impacted.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Sensitive information is temporarily stored and could be accessed. This implies some loss of confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  There is no indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | L     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     |
| Scope (S)            | U     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     |
| Integrity (I)        | N     |
| Availability (A)     | N     |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)] = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 1.82, 10)) = round_up(3.23) = 3.2

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
IBM Aspera Faspex 5.0.0 through 5.0.7 could allow a local user to obtain or modify sensitive information due to improper encryption of certain data.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability requires a "local user" to exploit it.  
  → AV:L (Local)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. Since it involves improper encryption, it likely does not require complex conditions.  
  → AC:L (Low)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as a "local user," which implies some level of access but not necessarily administrative or high privileges. Usually, "local user" means at least some user privileges.  
  → PR:L (Low)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The description does not mention the need for user interaction. Since the attacker is a local user, it is likely no additional user interaction is required.  
  → UI:N (None)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows a local user to obtain or modify sensitive information due to improper encryption. The impact is on the same component (the application itself), not on other components or systems.  
  → S:U (Unchanged)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can obtain sensitive information. This is at least a Low impact on confidentiality.  
  → C:L (Low)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can modify sensitive information. This is at least a Low impact on integrity.  
  → I:L (Low)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of impact on availability.  
  → A:N (None)

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local user required |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions mentioned |
| PR     | L     | Local user privileges required |

| I      | L     | Modification of sensitive information |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 1.82) = round_up(4.33) = 4.3

#####885#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An improper neutralization of input during web page generation (cross-site scripting) in Fortinet FortiNAC versions allows an attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via the name fields observed in the policy audit logs.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in a web application.  
- XSS typically requires the attacker to send crafted input that is processed by the web application and then executed in the victim's browser.  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complex steps to exploit.  
- XSS vulnerabilities are generally low complexity if the input is not sanitized.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability via the "name fields observed in the policy audit logs."  
- It is not explicitly stated that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- However, since the vulnerability involves input fields that are logged, it is likely the attacker needs to be able to submit input to the system, which may require at least some user privileges.  
- But since the description does not specify authentication or privileges, and XSS often can be exploited by unauthenticated users submitting input, we assume PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS requires the victim to view the malicious input in the web page (e.g., the audit logs page).  
- So, the attacker must trick a user (likely an administrator or user who views the logs) to view the malicious content.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows execution of unauthorized code or commands in the context of the web application.  
- XSS typically affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the victim user.  
- The description mentions "execute unauthorized code or commands," which can include stealing cookies or session tokens, leading to confidentiality impact.  
- So, Confidentiality impact is Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute unauthorized code, potentially modifying data or commands.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- Usually, XSS is considered to have Low integrity impact unless it allows full control.  
- Therefore, Integrity = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N).

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to submit input.                                                   |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must view the malicious input for code execution.                                  |

| Integrity (I)        | L      | Possible modification of data or commands via executed code.                             |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability mentioned.                                                     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.6084]  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.34)  
= 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in European Chemicals Agency IUCLID 7.10.3 on Windows.
- Affected component: Desktop Installer (iuclid6.exe).
- The issue: manipulation leads to incorrect default permissions.
- Attack vector: "The attack needs to be approached locally."
- Severity: classified as critical.
- No mention of user interaction.
- No explicit mention of privileges required.
- No explicit mention of scope change.
- Impact: incorrect default permissions (likely impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability).

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- "The attack needs to be approached locally."
- So, AV = Local (L).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- No mention of any special conditions or complexity.
- Usually, if not stated, assume Low (L).
- So, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attack is local and involves manipulation leading to incorrect default permissions.
- Since it involves "manipulation" and "incorrect default permissions," it likely requires some level of privileges.
- However, the description does not explicitly say "no privileges required."
- Since it is a local attack and involves changing permissions, it likely requires at least Low privileges.
- So, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention of user interaction.
- Usually, if not stated, assume None (N).
- So, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the Desktop Installer component.
- No mention that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- So, scope is likely Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- "Incorrect default permissions" can lead to unauthorized access.
- This likely impacts confidentiality to some degree.
- Since the vulnerability is classified as critical, assume High (H) impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**

- Incorrect permissions can allow unauthorized modification.
- So, integrity impact is likely High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- No explicit mention of availability impact.
- Incorrect permissions might not directly affect availability.
- So, assume None (N).

---

### Metric Analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by USB device probing, which requires physical connection of a USB device.  
- USB devices are considered Adjacent (A) because the attacker must be physically adjacent to the system to connect a USB device.  
- **AV:A**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires connecting a specially crafted or specific USB device to trigger the leak.  
- This is not trivial but also not highly complex.  
- Usually, USB device attacks are considered Low complexity if no special conditions are needed.  
- Here, the attacker just needs to connect a device, so **AC:L**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to connect a USB device; no privileges on the system are required.  
- **PR:N**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user does not need to interact beyond connecting the USB device.  
- The system automatically probes the device.  
- No additional user interaction required.  
- **UI:N**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel memory management subsystem.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (kernel memory).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects other components or security domains.  
- **S:U**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No indication of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- **C:N**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication of data modification or integrity impact.  
- **I:N**

**Availability (A):**  
- Memory leak can degrade system performance or cause denial of service over time.  
- This is a Low impact on availability (not immediate crash, but resource exhaustion).  
- **A:L**

### CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above metrics:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:L (0.22)

Calculate Impact:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 * 1 * 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.78 = 0.22

Impact Sub-Score (Scope Unchanged):  
ImpactSubScore = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.4124

Exploitability:  
Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.62 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.345  
= approx 2.84

Base Score (Scope Unchanged):  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(ImpactSubScore + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.4124 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(4.2524)  
= 4.3

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in LJ Apps WP Review Slider allows Stored XSS. This issue affects WP Review Slider: from n/a through 12.7.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a page containing the stored payload.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Stored XSS is typically exploitable remotely by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable web application, which stores the malicious script.  
- The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
- The attack is performed over the network (e.g., HTTP request).  
**Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stored XSS usually requires the attacker to submit crafted input that is stored and later rendered.  
- This is generally straightforward and does not require special conditions or timing.  
- Therefore, the complexity is low.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker typically does not need any privileges to submit input to the web application (e.g., comment form, review form).  
- The description does not mention any authentication requirement.  
**Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For XSS, the victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the payload to execute.  
- This requires user interaction (the victim browsing the page).  
**Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- Stored XSS affects the security context of the user visiting the page, but it does not affect the underlying system or other components beyond the web application’s scope.  
- The vulnerability impacts the same security scope (web application).  
**Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute scripts that can modify or manipulate data visible to the user or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
**Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- Stored XSS generally does not impact availability of the system.  
- No denial of service or resource exhaustion is described.  
**Value:** None (N)

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.3

  No indication of special conditions or complexity; typical use-after-free vulnerabilities are straightforward to exploit once reachable.  
  **AC:L (Low)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and presumably does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.  
  **PR:N (None)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required; the attacker can cause DoS remotely.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a denial of service in the same component (no indication that it affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or changes privileges).  
  The scope is likely unchanged.  
  **S:U (Unchanged)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability causes denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
  **C:N (None)**

- **Integrity (I):**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(7.47) = 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Brian D. Goad pTypeConverter. This issue affects pTypeConverter: from n/a through 0.2.8.1.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** SQL Injection  
- **Affected component:** pTypeConverter library  
- **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
SQL Injection typically can be exploited remotely over the network if the vulnerable component processes user input that reaches a database. Since pTypeConverter is a library, the context matters, but generally, SQL Injection is exploitable over the network if the application exposes the vulnerable functionality remotely.  
- **AV:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the input is not sanitized properly and no additional conditions are needed.  
- **AC:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
If the attacker can send input that reaches the vulnerable SQL query without authentication, then no privileges are required. If the library is used in a context where authentication is needed, PR might be Low or High. However, the description does not mention any authentication requirement.  
- **PR:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
SQL Injection typically does not require user interaction beyond the attacker sending crafted input.  
- **UI:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
If the vulnerability allows impact beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., affecting the database or other components), scope is Changed (C). SQL Injection can affect the database, which is outside the vulnerable component boundary.  
- **S:** Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized data disclosure. Usually, this is High impact.  
- **C:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
SQL Injection can allow data modification or deletion. This is also High impact.  
- **I:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
SQL Injection can lead to denial of service by deleting data or locking tables, but this is less common or less severe than confidentiality and integrity impacts. Usually, this is Low or None. Given the potential, we assign Low.  
- **A:** Low (L)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity attack |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses component boundary (to DB) |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Low availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online tool with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Base Score:** Approximately 9.8 (Critical)

#####891#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Axigen WebMail prior to 10.3.3.61 allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via a crafted script to the serverName_input parameter.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely ("remote attacker") and involves a webmail interface. This implies the attack can be launched over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker uses a crafted script to exploit the vulnerability. There is no indication of special conditions or timing requirements. Usually, XSS vulnerabilities have low complexity.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "remote attacker" and the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, implying the attacker starts with no privileges.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  XSS vulnerabilities typically require the victim to interact with the malicious script (e.g., by visiting a crafted URL or opening a malicious email). However, the description says "allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via a crafted script to the serverName_input parameter," which suggests the attacker directly sends the crafted input to the server parameter. This likely does not require user interaction.  
  **UI = None (N)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which means the attacker can affect resources beyond their initial scope. This implies the scope is changed.  
  **S = Changed (C)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Privilege escalation usually implies the attacker can access or disclose sensitive information. So confidentiality impact is high.  
  **C = High (H)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Privilege escalation implies the attacker can modify data or system state.  
  **I = High (H)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | C     | Privilege escalation changes scope |
| C      | H     | High confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

#####892#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: Video PopUp plugin for WordPress (up to v1.1.3)
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes
- Attack scenario: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions can inject arbitrary scripts
- Impact: Scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via a shortcode attribute.  
- The injection happens through the web interface, and the attacker does not need physical or local access to the server.  
- The attacker must be logged in with contributor-level permissions, so the attack is not purely remote without authentication.  
- However, the injection is done over the network (HTTP request).  
- According to CVSS v3.1, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network, AV is Network (N).  
- Since the attacker must be authenticated, but the attack is performed over the network, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the required permissions.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor-level is a low privilege but not none.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, contributor-level is considered Low privileges.  
- PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The injected script executes when any user accesses the injected page.  
- The attacker injects the script, but the victim user must view the page for the script to execute.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required (the victim must view the page).  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the plugin and the WordPress site.  
- The impact is on the same security scope (the WordPress application).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users who view the page.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying content or performing actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- No indication that the attack causes denial of service.  
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploitation |
| PR     | L     | Contributor-level privileges required |
| UI     | R     | Victim must view the injected page |
| S      | U     | Impact within same security scope |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.3844  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.296  
≈ 8.22 × 0.2516  
≈ 2.07

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.52

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(2.52 + 2.07, 10))  
= round_up(4.59)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in RRJ Nueva Ecija Engineer Online Portal 1.0
- Affected component: /admin/admin_user.php (Admin Panel)
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of Firstname/Lastname/Username parameters
- Attack can be launched remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is launched remotely over the network (e.g., via web interface).  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically require low complexity to exploit if no special conditions are needed.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complex steps.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in the admin panel, but the description does not specify that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- However, the affected file is /admin/admin_user.php, which might suggest admin access is required. But since the attack is described as "can be launched remotely" and no mention of authentication is made, we assume no privileges required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS typically requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page).  
- Since this is a reflected or stored XSS, user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually, this is considered a Low impact on confidentiality unless explicitly stated.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically considered Low impact on integrity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(5.19) = 5.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####894#####
Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WP Spell Check.

**Step 1: Understand the vulnerability**

- **Type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Affected software:** WP Spell Check up to version 9.17
- **Description:** CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs some action without their consent.

**Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric**

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network since the attacker lures the victim to a malicious website or sends a crafted link. The attacker does not need local or physical access.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page). However, no special conditions or environment configurations are needed beyond that. This is generally considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system; however, the victim must be authenticated (have privileges). For CVSS, PR is from the attacker's perspective. Since the attacker does not need privileges on the target system, PR is None.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim to interact, e.g., visit a malicious website or click a link.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions, but typically does not directly disclose confidential information. However, depending on the action, it might lead to some data exposure. Since the description does not mention data disclosure, we assume no confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF allows unauthorized commands to be executed, which can modify data or state. This is an integrity impact. Usually, this is considered Low or High depending on the severity. Since the description is generic and does not specify full control or destructive actions, we assign Low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF typically does not affect availability unless the action causes denial of service. No such indication here.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

**Summary of metric values:**

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: N (None)  
- I: L (Low)  
- A: N (None)

**Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score**

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(4.09)  
= 4.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's crypto RSA code.  
- The issue is about adding a check for allocation failure to prevent NULL dereference.  
- The vulnerability is theoretical because small allocations can't actually fail in current kernels, but the check was added for safety and to satisfy static analysis tools.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel crypto RSA code.  
- Kernel code is typically local or requires local access to exploit.  
- Since this is a NULL dereference due to allocation failure, it likely requires local code execution or local access.  
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely or over the network.  
- **AV = Local (L)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The issue is about allocation failure, which is rare or impossible in current kernels for small allocations.  
- Exploiting this would be complex or unlikely.  
- The fix is to prevent NULL dereference, so the vulnerability is low impact and hard to trigger.  
- **AC = High (H)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since this is kernel code, to trigger this vulnerability, the attacker likely needs to run code in kernel context or at least have some privileges.  
- Usually, local kernel vulnerabilities require at least low privileges (e.g., user-level access).  
- No indication that root privileges are required.  
- **PR = Low (L)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required.  
- Kernel code runs without user interaction.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel, and a NULL dereference could cause a kernel crash (denial of service).  
- Kernel crashes affect the entire system, so the impact crosses security boundaries.  
- Therefore, scope is changed.  
- **S = Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- NULL dereference leading to crash does not leak information.  
- No confidentiality impact.  
- **C = None (N)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data can be modified or corrupted.  
- Only a crash is possible.  
- **I = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- NULL dereference can cause kernel crash, leading to denial of service.  
- This impacts availability.  
- Severity is likely low or high depending on context, but since it's a kernel crash, it is usually High.  
- **A = High (H)**

- AC:H (High)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:H (High)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:H = 0.44  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:N = 0.0  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.68 * 0.85 ≈ 1.37

**Impact (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * 0.56 ≈ 4.21

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else: Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (4.21 + 1.37), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 5.58, 10))  
= round_up(6.02) = 6.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM Sterling Control Center 6.3.0 allows a remote attacker to perform directory traversal by sending specially crafted URL requests containing "../" sequences, enabling viewing of arbitrary files on the system.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed remotely by sending a specially crafted URL request. This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack involves sending a crafted URL with "../" sequences. This is a straightforward directory traversal attack, requiring no special conditions or timing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and can send the request without any authentication or privileges mentioned.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker sends the request directly; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows viewing arbitrary files on the system, but it does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. Directory traversal typically affects the same security scope (the vulnerable application or system).  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can view arbitrary files, which leads to information disclosure. This is more than just partial information, but not necessarily full system compromise.  
  **Value:** High (H) — because arbitrary file viewing can expose sensitive data.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The vulnerability description does not mention the ability to modify files or data.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication that availability is affected.  
  **Value:** None (N)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Out of bounds write due to missing bounds check.
- Impact: Local escalation of privilege.
- Privileges required: System execution privileges needed.
- User interaction: Not needed.
- Attack vector: Local (implied by "local escalation" and "System execution privileges needed").

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The vulnerability requires local access (local escalation of privilege).  
   - Therefore, AV = **L** (Local).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - No mention of any special conditions or complexity.  
   - Usually, out of bounds write with missing bounds check is straightforward.  
   - AC = **L** (Low).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - "System execution privileges needed" means the attacker must already have high privileges.  
   - PR = **H** (High).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
   - UI = **N** (None).

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability leads to local privilege escalation within the same system.  
   - No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
   - S = **U** (Unchanged).

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - Out of bounds write leading to privilege escalation may allow reading sensitive data.  
   - However, the description focuses on privilege escalation, not data disclosure.  
   - Usually, privilege escalation implies at least some confidentiality impact.  
   - Assign **L** (Low) for confidentiality.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - Privilege escalation implies the attacker can modify system or data integrity.  
   - Assign **H** (High) for integrity.

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - No mention of availability impact.  
   - Assign **N** (None).

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:H (High)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:H (High)  
- A:N (None)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:H (Scope Unchanged) = 0.27  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.0977 ≈ 0.803

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 6.42 * 0.6568 ≈ 4.22

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(4.22 + 0.803, 10))  
= round_up(5.023) = 5.0

#####898#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In TVAPI, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The description implies the attacker must have local access since it mentions "local escalation of privilege." No indication that this can be exploited remotely or over the network.  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of any special conditions or complexity. The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check, which is typically straightforward to exploit once local access is obtained.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "System execution privileges needed," which means the attacker must already have high privileges (System level) to exploit this.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  "User interaction is not needed for exploitation."  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability leads to local escalation of privilege but does not indicate that the impact crosses security boundaries beyond the vulnerable component. Since the privileges escalate within the same scope (local system), scope is likely unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention any confidentiality impact. The main impact is privilege escalation.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Out of bounds write can lead to privilege escalation, which implies the attacker can modify system or application data. This is a high integrity impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value  | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L      | Local access required                           |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L      | Straightforward exploitation                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| H    | System execution privileges needed              |
| User Interaction (UI)| N       | No user interaction needed                      |
| Scope (S)            | U       | Impact within the same security scope           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N       | No confidentiality impact                        |
| Integrity (I)        | H       | High integrity impact due to privilege escalation|
| Availability (A)     | N       | No availability impact                           |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.27 × 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 0.44 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(4.38)  
= 4.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

#####899#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
An issue in libxml2 (versions before 2.11.7 and 2.12.x before 2.12.5) occurs when using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation and XInclude expansion enabled. Processing crafted XML documents can lead to an xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free vulnerability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing crafted XML documents.  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely by sending malicious XML data.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability requires the XML Reader interface to be used with DTD validation and XInclude expansion enabled.  
- This is a specific configuration and not the default, which adds some complexity.  
- However, no additional conditions like timing or race conditions are mentioned.  
- This suggests **Low (L)** complexity because the attacker only needs to send crafted XML under certain configurations.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker only needs to supply crafted XML documents.  
- No mention of needing any privileges on the system.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing XML documents.  
- Usually, this means the user or system must process the XML.  
- If the XML is processed automatically by an application without user action, UI is None.  
- But if the user must open or load the XML, UI is Required.  
- The description does not specify user action, but typically XML processing libraries are used programmatically without user interaction.  
- Assume **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the libxml2 library.  
- It likely affects the same security scope (the library or application process).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data leakage, but use-after-free can cause crashes or leaks.  
- Assume **Low (L)** impact on confidentiality.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Use-after-free can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or corrupt memory.  
- This can lead to modification of data or code execution.  
- So, **High (H)** impact on integrity.

**Availability (A):**  
- Use-after-free can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **Low (L)** or **High (H)** impact on availability.  
- Since the description does not mention full denial of service, but use-after-free often causes crashes, assume **Low (L)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely via crafted XML documents over network.                               |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Requires specific configuration but no complex conditions.                                 |
| Privileges Required (PR) | N  | No privileges needed to send crafted XML.                                                 |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required; processing is automatic.                                    |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects the same security scope.                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible information disclosure due to memory corruption.                                 |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | High impact due to potential code execution or data modification.                          |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Possible crashes causing partial denial of service.                                       |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**  
Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.268 ≈ 0.732

Impact Score = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.732 ≈ 4.70

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.70 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(8.61) = 8.6 → 9.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.085  
= 0.915

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
= 5.88

**Base Score:**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (5.88 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (9.77)  
= 9.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability in flusity-CMS v.2.33 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the add_customblock.php.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely ("remote attacker"), so the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks typically require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visiting a malicious page). This usually means the attack complexity is **Low (L)** because no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since the attacker can execute arbitrary code via CSRF, the victim user must have some privileges. Usually, CSRF attacks require the victim to be logged in with some privileges. The description does not specify if the attacker needs to be authenticated or not, but since arbitrary code execution is possible, it likely requires the victim to be authenticated with at least **Low (L)** privileges.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  CSRF requires the victim to perform some action (e.g., visiting a malicious page), so **User Interaction is Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code, which likely affects the same security scope (the CMS application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component, so **Scope is Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full data compromise, so **High (H)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution allows full modification of data, so **High (H)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt service, so **High (H)**.

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attacker can exploit over the network                                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions beyond user interaction                                             |
| Privileges Required (PR) | L  | Attacker requires victim to be authenticated with some privileges                         |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must perform an action (e.g., visit malicious page)                                |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Arbitrary code execution leads to full data compromise                                   |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Arbitrary code execution leads to full data modification                                 |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Arbitrary code execution can disrupt service                                             |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact Sub-Score = 6.42 * Impact**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact Sub-Score + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 2.05, 10))  
= round_up(7.93) = 7.9

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####902#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Posts to Page Kerry James allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Kerry James: from n/a through 1.7.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely via the network (e.g., through a web interface).  
- **Attack Complexity:** Typically low for XSS, as it usually requires only sending crafted input.  
- **Privileges Required:** None, as the attacker only needs to submit malicious input (no authentication required).  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the payload to execute.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal user data, cookies, session tokens)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify displayed content or perform actions on behalf of the user)  
  - Availability: None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**       | N     | Network - attacker can exploit remotely via web interface                                  |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)**   | L     | Low - no special conditions required                                                     |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | N     | None - attacker does not need any privileges                                              |
| **User Interaction (UI)**    | R     | Required - victim must visit the malicious page                                          |
| **Scope (S)**                | U     | Unchanged - vulnerability affects the same security scope                                |
| **Confidentiality (C)**      | L     | Low - attacker can access some sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens)             |
| **Integrity (I)**            | L     | Low - attacker can modify content or perform actions as victim                           |
| **Availability (A)**         | N     | None - no impact on availability                                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact:**  
= 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
= Round up to nearest 0.1 of minimum of (Impact + Exploitability, 10)  
= 2.51 + 2.82 = 5.33 → 5.4

---

### Final Summary:

- **AV:** Network (N)  
- **AC:** Low (L)  
- **PR:** None (N)  
- **UI:** Required (R)  
- **S:** Unchanged (U)  
- **C:** Low (L)  
- **I:** Low (L)  
- **A:** None (N)

#####903#####
Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
"Missing Authorization vulnerability in WP Job Portal WP Job Portal – A Complete Job Board. This issue affects WP Job Portal – A Complete Job Board: from n/a through 2.0.1."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Missing Authorization vulnerability  
- **Affected product:** WP Job Portal – A Complete Job Board  
- **Impact:** Missing authorization typically means that an attacker can perform actions or access resources without proper permission checks.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   Since this is a web application plugin, the attack can be performed remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
   **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   Missing authorization is usually straightforward to exploit if the attacker knows the endpoint or action to perform. No special conditions or environment needed.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   Missing authorization means the attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.  
   **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   Typically, missing authorization vulnerabilities do not require user interaction; the attacker can send crafted requests directly.  
   **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component?  
   Since this is a missing authorization in the same application, the scope is likely unchanged.  
   **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   Missing authorization can allow unauthorized access to data, so confidentiality is impacted. The description does not specify full data disclosure, so assume **Low (L)**.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   Missing authorization can allow unauthorized modification of data or actions. Assume **Low (L)** since the description does not specify full control.  
   **Value:** Low (L)

8. **Availability (A):**  
   Missing authorization usually does not impact availability unless specified. Assume **None (N)**.  
   **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: L (Low)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22** (calculated as 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85)  
**Impact = 0.56** (calculated as 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.00)] = 0.3936, then multiplied by 6.42 = 2.52)  
Wait, let's do the exact calculation:

- Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

- Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
= 2.515

- Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473  
= 3.89

- Since Scope is Unchanged, Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.515 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(6.405)  
= 6.4

- Affected file: admin/inc/auth.inc.php.
- The issue is due to manipulation of the argument `auth` leading to incorrect comparison.
- The attack may be launched remotely.
- Attack complexity is rather high; exploitation is known to be difficult.
- Exploit has been publicly disclosed.
- No version details available due to rolling release.
- Patch is recommended.

---

### Metric Analysis:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - "The attack may be launched remotely."  
   - This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.  
   - **Value:** Network (N)

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - "The complexity of an attack is rather high."  
   - "Exploitation is known to be difficult."  
   - **Value:** High (H)

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - No mention of needing any privileges.  
   - The attack is launched remotely and manipulates an argument (`auth`), likely without authentication.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - No mention that user interaction is required.  
   - The attacker can send the malicious input directly.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - The vulnerability is in a single component (auth.inc.php).  
   - No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
   - **Value:** Unchanged (U)

6. **Confidentiality (C):**

   - Usually, authentication bypass impacts confidentiality to some extent (e.g., unauthorized access to data).  
   - Given the lack of explicit data leak, but possible unauthorized access, assign **Low (L)**.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - Authentication bypass can allow unauthorized modification of data or actions.  
   - This implies some impact on integrity.  
   - Assign **Low (L)**.

8. **Availability (A):**  
   - No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
   - **Value:** None (N)

= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

#####905#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in wpa_supplicant's PEAP implementation allows authentication bypass.
- Requires wpa_supplicant to be configured to **not verify the network's TLS certificate** during Phase 1.
- Attack vector: sending an EAP-TLV Success packet instead of starting Phase 2.
- Result: adversary can impersonate Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted EAP-TLV Success packet.
- EAP packets are sent over the network (wireless).
- The attacker does not need physical access or local access.
- Therefore, **AV = Network (N)**.

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack requires wpa_supplicant to be configured to **not verify the TLS certificate**.
- This is a misconfiguration, not a default setting.
- The attacker must exploit a specific vulnerability (eap_peap_decrypt) and send a crafted packet.
- This indicates some conditions must be met, but no special timing or environment complexity is mentioned.
- The requirement of a misconfiguration increases complexity somewhat.
- Therefore, **AC = High (H)**.

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker is an external entity impersonating a Wi-Fi network.
- No privileges on the victim system are required.
- Therefore, **PR = None (N)**.

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack involves the client connecting to a rogue network impersonated by the attacker.
- The user must attempt to connect to the network (or be tricked into doing so).
- This implies user interaction is required (e.g., user initiates connection).
- Therefore, **UI = Required (R)**.

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication in wpa_supplicant.
- The impact is on the same security authority (wpa_supplicant process).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- Therefore, **S = Unchanged (U)**.

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker impersonates the network, potentially intercepting or manipulating data.
- However, the description focuses on authentication bypass, not direct data disclosure.
- The attacker can impersonate the network, which may lead to disclosure of user data.
- This suggests at least some confidentiality impact.
- Given the attacker can impersonate the network, **Confidentiality = Low (L)**.

---

**Integrity (I):**

- By impersonating the network, the attacker can manipulate data or inject malicious content.
- This implies some integrity impact.
- Therefore, **Integrity = Low (L)**.

---

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- Therefore, **Availability = None (N)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning Summary |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network (wireless) |
| AC     | H     | Requires misconfiguration and crafted packet |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must attempt to connect to network |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to wpa_supplicant scope |
| C      | L     | Possible data disclosure via impersonation |
| I      | L     | Possible data manipulation via impersonation |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.44 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.197  
≈ 1.62

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

Let's analyze the CVE description for the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WPChill Strong Testimonials.

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affects: Strong Testimonials plugin versions up to 3.1.10
- Impact: CSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
CSRF attacks are typically executed over the network since the attacker lures the victim to a malicious website or link.  
- AV: Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated and to perform some action (e.g., visit a malicious page). However, no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.  
- AC: Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
The attacker does not need privileges on the target system; the victim must be authenticated. The attacker exploits the victim's privileges.  
- PR: None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
User interaction is required because the victim must perform an action (e.g., click a link or visit a page).  
- UI: Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application). No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S: Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
CSRF usually does not directly disclose confidential information. The attacker forces actions but does not read data.  
- C: None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
CSRF can allow unauthorized actions that modify data or state, so integrity is impacted at a Low level (e.g., changing settings, posting content).  
- I: Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
CSRF generally does not impact availability.  
- A: None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (click link) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Integrity impacted at low level |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.78  
= 0.22

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U),  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (1.41 + 2.25)  
= Roundup (3.66)  
= 3.7 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's nvmet-tcp subsystem.
- Triggered when a host sends an invalid H2C PDU length (H2CData command with invalid DATAL).
- Causes a kernel panic due to a NULL pointer dereference.
- The issue is fixed by validating the PDU length and raising a fatal error if invalid.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by a host sending a malformed packet over the network (nvmet-tcp is a network protocol).  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires sending an invalid H2C PDU length.  
- This is a straightforward malformed packet, no special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is a host communicating over the network.  
- No privileges on the target system are required to send the malformed packet.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is triggered by the host sending a malformed packet.  
- No user interaction is required on the victim side.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a kernel panic (denial of service) in the Linux kernel.  
- The impact is within the kernel, but the kernel is part of the same security authority.  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the kernel itself.  
- The scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash (denial of service), no indication of data disclosure.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data can be modified or corrupted by the attacker.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The kernel panic causes a denial of service (system crash).  
- This is a **High (H)** impact on availability.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Network attack via malformed packet             |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Simple malformed packet, no special conditions  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to send packet           |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                     |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact limited to kernel, no scope change        |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No data disclosure                               |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No data modification                             |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Kernel panic causes high availability impact    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.5952

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (3.5952 + 3.89)  
= Roundup (7.4852)  
= 7.5

#####908#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Tenda AC10U firmware version 15.03.06.49_multi_TDE01.
- Critical severity.
- Affected function: fromDhcpListClient.
- Cause: Manipulation of argument page/listN leads to stack-based buffer overflow.
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Vendor was contacted but did not respond.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- This implies the attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Likely over the network (e.g., via network interface).  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.  
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and presumably straightforward.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely without credentials.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker can exploit remotely without user involvement.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in a function of the device firmware.  
- Usually, a buffer overflow in a component that leads to code execution or crash within the same security scope (same component or system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., no privilege escalation to other components or systems).  
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.  
- No explicit mention of data disclosure, but buffer overflows often can lead to information disclosure.  
- Given critical severity and stack overflow, likely at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Since the description does not explicitly mention data leakage, but the exploit is critical, assume **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow attacker to execute arbitrary code or manipulate data.  
- This implies at least a low integrity impact.  
- Given critical severity, possibly high integrity impact.  
- Since the description is about stack overflow and manipulation of arguments, likely attacker can modify data or code execution.  
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Likely availability is impacted.  
- Given critical severity, assume **High (H)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |

| Availability (A)     | H      | Likely crash or denial of service                                                          |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.151 = 0.849

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score = Impact + Exploitability**  
= 5.45 + 3.88 = 9.33

Since Scope is Unchanged, no adjustment needed.

Round up to one decimal place: **9.3**

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H**

#####909#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"Vim before 9.0.2142 has a stack-based buffer overflow because did_set_langmap in map.c calls sprintf to write to the error buffer that is passed down to the option callback functions."

---

### Step 1: Analyze each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in Vim, a text editor, and involves a buffer overflow triggered by a function call.  
- Typically, such vulnerabilities require the attacker to open a crafted file or input data locally.  
- There is no indication that this can be exploited remotely over a network.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by a specific function call.  
- Exploiting buffer overflows usually requires precise input but not necessarily complex conditions.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.  
- So, **Low (L)** complexity.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- To exploit this, the attacker likely needs to run Vim and open a crafted file or input.  
- Running Vim does not require elevated privileges; a normal user can run it.  
- So, **None (N)** privileges required.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered when Vim processes input (e.g., opening a file or setting an option).  
- The user must open or load the crafted input to trigger the overflow.  
- This means user interaction is **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in Vim's process memory.  
- It does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (Vim process).  
- So, **Unchanged (U)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.  
- The description does not explicitly mention information disclosure, but buffer overflows often can lead to at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Given the nature of the overflow, assume **High (H)** confidentiality impact (possible full data disclosure).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow arbitrary code execution, which can modify data or code.  
- So, **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, **High (H)** availability impact.

|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local execution required                        |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions needed                    |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed to run Vim                 |
| User Interaction (UI) | R     | User must open or load crafted input            |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects only Vim process          |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Possible full data disclosure                    |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Possible arbitrary code execution/modification  |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Possible crash or denial of service              |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.915 = 5.88

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(7.71) = 7.7

#####910#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- CubeFS uses an insecure random string generator to create user-specific sensitive keys ("accessKey").
- An attacker can predict/guess the accessKey and impersonate a user.
- This impersonation allows the attacker to obtain higher privileges.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.3.1.
- No other mitigations exist.

---

### Metric Analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker guesses the accessKey to impersonate a user.  
- The description does not specify that the attacker must be local or adjacent; guessing keys is typically done remotely over the network.  
- Therefore, **AV:N (Network)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The random string generator is insecure and predictable, making guessing feasible.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges to guess the accessKey.  
- The attacker is impersonating a user by guessing the key, so no prior privileges are needed.  
- Therefore, **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker guesses the key and impersonates the user without requiring any other user to perform an action.  
- Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker impersonates a user and obtains higher privileges within the same CubeFS deployment.  
- The description implies the attacker gains higher privileges than the compromised user, but it is within the same security scope (CubeFS system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can impersonate a user by guessing the accessKey, which is sensitive information.  
- This leads to unauthorized access to user data.  
- The impact is more than none but not necessarily full system-wide data disclosure.  
- Therefore, **C:L (Low)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- By impersonating a user with higher privileges, the attacker can modify data or configurations.  
- This is a direct impact on integrity.  
- The description says "obtain higher privileges," implying the attacker can modify data.  
- Therefore, **I:L (Low)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- Therefore, **A:N (None)**.

### Optional: Base Score Calculation (for completeness)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

Calculate Impact:

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Sub-Score (Scope Unchanged):

Impact = 6.42 * Impact  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
= 2.515

Exploitability:

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565  
= 8.22 * 0.473

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The Estatik Real Estate Plugin WordPress plugin before 4.1.1 unserializes user input via some of its cookies, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget chain is present on the blog.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via cookies, which are sent over the network.  
- The attacker does not need physical or local access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires a "suitable gadget chain" to be present on the blog. This implies some conditions must be met and the attack is not straightforward.  
- This increases complexity.  
- Therefore, AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is "unauthenticated," meaning no privileges are required.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted cookies; no user interaction is required from the victim.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows PHP Object Injection, which can lead to code execution or other impacts within the same security scope (the plugin or application).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope (e.g., kernel or other system components).  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- PHP Object Injection can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.  
- The impact is likely more than none but may not be total disclosure.  
- Assign Low (L) or High (H)? Given the potential severity of PHP Object Injection, it can lead to full disclosure. However, since the description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but the possibility exists, we assign Low (L) to be conservative.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- PHP Object Injection can allow modification of data or code execution, impacting integrity.  
- This is likely High (H) because it can allow arbitrary code execution or modification.  
- Therefore, I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- PHP Object Injection can lead to denial of service or other availability impacts.  
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but code execution can cause availability issues.  
- Assign Low (L) to reflect possible but not guaranteed impact.  
- Therefore, A = Low (L).

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack via network (cookies sent over network)                                            |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Requires suitable gadget chain, increasing complexity                                     |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Unauthenticated attacker                                                                  |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                                              |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact within the same security scope                                                     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Possible information disclosure                                                           |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Potential for code execution/modification                                                 |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Possible impact on availability                                                           |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:H (0.44)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.44 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.318  
= 8.22 * 0.2703  
≈ 2.22

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.44 * 0.78]  
= 1 - [0.268]  
= 0.732

Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.732  
= 4.70

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(Min(4.70 + 2.22, 10))  
= Roundup(6.92)  
= 6.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####912#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Laybuy Laybuy Payment Extension for WooCommerce allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Laybuy Payment Extension for WooCommerce: from n/a through 5.3.9.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a vulnerable page.  
- **Affected component:** WooCommerce payment extension (web application plugin).  
- **Attack vector:** Likely remote via network (web interface).  
- **Privileges:** Usually, XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated users or authenticated users depending on the context. Since this is a payment extension, it might be accessible to any user visiting the site (including unauthenticated visitors).  
- **User interaction:** The victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the attack to succeed.  
- **Scope:** The vulnerability affects the web application itself, and the impact is on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the user's browser session or data accessible via the browser. The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application).  

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network (via web).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Stored XSS usually requires low complexity: attacker just needs to inject a script and have a victim visit the page. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Typically, stored XSS can be exploited without any privileges if the input form is publicly accessible. Since this is a payment extension, it might be accessible to any user (including unauthenticated). The description does not specify that authentication is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must visit the page containing the malicious script for the attack to succeed.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application). The impact is on the web app and the user's browser session, but the security scope does not change to another component or system.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible via the browser. This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can execute scripts that can modify the content displayed to the user or perform actions on behalf of the user, which is a partial loss of integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not affect availability directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Exploitable remotely over the network (web).                                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to inject malicious script.                                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must visit the malicious page.                                                     |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects the same security scope (web app).                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Partial loss of confidentiality (e.g., cookie theft).                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Partial loss of integrity (e.g., script execution/modification of displayed content).      |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability.                                                                |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.68)  
= round_up(5.19)  
= 5.2 (Medium severity)

#####913#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Buffer overflow vulnerability in the FLP module. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause out-of-bounds read."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Buffer overflow vulnerability  
- **Impact:** May cause out-of-bounds read (which typically affects confidentiality, possibly integrity depending on context, but here primarily confidentiality)  
- **Module:** FLP module (no further context on access method)  

---

### Step 2: Assign values for each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Since no physical or local access is mentioned, and buffer overflow vulnerabilities are often exploitable remotely if the module is network-facing, assume **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity; buffer overflow is usually straightforward to exploit if accessible. So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that attacker needs privileges; assume **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required; assume **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component; assume **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure, so **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification or corruption of data; assume **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact; assume **None (N)**.

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: N (None)  
- A: N (None)  

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or standard tables:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(5.32) = 5.3

#####914#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex Central.  
- Allows a remote attacker to create arbitrary files on affected installations.  
- Authentication is required, but any valid credentials suffice.  
- Potentially exploitable in combination with other vulnerabilities for code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and can exploit over the network.  
- No indication that physical or local access is required.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is an unrestricted file upload, which is generally straightforward once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Authentication is required, but any valid credentials suffice.  
- This implies Low privileges are needed (not None, since authentication is required).  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is remote and uses their own credentials; no indication that another user must interact.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows creating arbitrary files on the affected installation.  
- This likely affects the same security authority (the same component or system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows creating arbitrary files, but no direct mention of data disclosure.  
- Creating files could indirectly lead to data exposure, but not explicitly stated.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality impact is Low (L) because arbitrary files could be used to access or exfiltrate data.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary file creation impacts integrity because files can be modified or replaced.  
- Therefore, Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- No direct mention of availability impact (e.g., denial of service).  
- However, arbitrary file creation could potentially disrupt availability, but this is not explicit.  
- To be conservative, assign Low (L) availability impact.

- Privileges: None (attacker is unauthenticated)
- Scope: The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin settings)
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: Modifying settings affects Integrity and possibly Availability, but no direct confidentiality impact mentioned.

---

### Metric Analysis

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network by tricking an admin to click a link.  
- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must trick an admin into clicking a malicious link, but no other complex conditions are required.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated and requires no privileges.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the site administrator to perform an action (click a link).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (WordPress plugin settings). No indication that the scope changes beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- C = None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can modify virtual event settings, which is an integrity impact.  
- The impact is likely Low because it modifies settings but does not fully compromise the system or data.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- No explicit mention of availability impact. Modifying settings might cause some disruption but not clearly stated.  
- Assume no availability impact.  
- A = None (N)

### Summary of Metrics

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:N (None)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.68, 10))  
= round_up(4.09) = 4.1

Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
DOCSIS dissector crash in Wireshark 4.2.0 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Denial of Service (DoS) via crash.
- **Component:** DOCSIS dissector in Wireshark 4.2.0.
- **Attack vector:** Packet injection or crafted capture file.
- **Impact:** Crash (availability impact).
- **Privileges:** Not explicitly stated, but Wireshark typically runs with user privileges.
- **User interaction:** Not explicitly stated, but opening a crafted capture file or receiving a packet could require user action.
- **Scope:** Likely unchanged, as the vulnerability affects Wireshark itself.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack can be performed via packet injection (network) or crafted capture file (local file).  
  Packet injection implies network access to the victim's Wireshark instance (e.g., capturing live traffic).  
  Crafted capture file implies local file opening.  
  Since packet injection is possible, and Wireshark captures network traffic, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attack involves sending crafted packets or a crafted file to cause a crash.  
  No special conditions or timing required.  
  So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Wireshark typically runs with user privileges, and the attacker does not need any privileges on the victim machine to send packets or provide a crafted file.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For packet injection, no user interaction is needed if the victim is capturing live traffic.  
  For crafted capture file, the user must open the file in Wireshark.  
  Since either vector is possible, and one requires user interaction, the more conservative approach is to consider **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a crash in Wireshark itself, no privilege escalation or impact beyond the application.  
  So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No confidentiality impact mentioned.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No integrity impact mentioned.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Denial of Service via crash impacts availability.  
  Crash is a total denial of service, so **High (H)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Network via packet injection                    |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                            |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | User must open crafted file or capture live traffic (packet injection may not require UI, but crafted file does) |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.60 + 2.68) = Round_up (6.28) = 6.3

#####917#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Oliver Seidel, Bastian Germann cformsII allows Stored XSS. This issue affects cformsII: from n/a through 15.0.5.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.  
- **Attack Vector:** Since this is a web application vulnerability, the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network by submitting crafted input that gets stored and later executed in other users' browsers.  
- **Privileges Required:** None, as anyone can submit input to the web form.  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must visit the page containing the stored malicious script for the attack to succeed.  
- **Scope:** Unchanged, because the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application).  
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal cookies or session tokens, but not full system access)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify displayed content or perform actions on behalf of the user)  
  - Availability: None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**       | N     | Network - attacker can exploit remotely over the network                                  |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)**   | L     | Low - no special conditions required to exploit                                           |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | N     | None - attacker does not need any privileges                                              |
| **User Interaction (UI)**    | R     | Required - victim must interact by visiting the page                                     |
| **Scope (S)**                | U     | Unchanged - vulnerability affects resources within the same security scope               |
| **Confidentiality (C)**      | L     | Low - attacker can access some sensitive information (e.g., cookies)                     |
| **Integrity (I)**            | L     | Low - attacker can modify content or perform actions as the user                         |
| **Availability (A)**         | N     | None - no impact on availability                                                         |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
= round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.33) = 5.3

---

### Final Summary:

- **AV:** Network (N)  
- **AC:** Low (L)  
- **PR:** None (N)  
- **UI:** Required (R)  
- **S:** Unchanged (U)  
- **C:** Low (L)  
- **I:** Low (L)  
- **A:** None (N)  
- **Base Score:** 5.3 (Medium severity)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. A malicious URL can be used to execute XSS on reports pages. Upgrade to 10.0.12."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Attack vector:** Malicious URL used to execute XSS on reports pages.
- **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary script in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Scope:** Likely unchanged (the vulnerability affects the same security scope).
- **Privileges:** None required to exploit (any user can send a malicious URL).
- **User Interaction:** Required (victim must click or visit the malicious URL).
- **Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Usually, XSS impacts confidentiality and integrity to some extent, but availability is typically unaffected.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via a URL, which is delivered over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

  No privileges required to exploit the vulnerability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must click or visit the malicious URL for the XSS to execute.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. This is a partial impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify the content seen by the user, potentially injecting malicious scripts. This is a partial impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable over the network via URL           |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])**  
= Roundup(2.51 + 2.82) = Roundup(5.33) = 5.3

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

#####919#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"The authentication mechanism can be bypassed by overflowing the value of the Cookie 'authentication' field, provided there is an active user session."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack involves overflowing a cookie value, which is typically sent over the network (HTTP request).  
- The attacker must send a crafted request to the server.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to overflow a cookie value, which is a specific condition but does not seem to require special conditions or timing.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or race conditions.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description says "provided there is an active user session."  
- This implies the attacker must be authenticated or have an active session, so some privileges are required.  
- Since the attacker needs to be an authenticated user (active session), this corresponds to **Low (L)** privileges.  
- If it required admin or high privileges, it would be High (H), but here it just requires an active user session.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is exploiting a cookie overflow, presumably by sending a crafted request.  
- No mention of needing another user to do anything.  
- The attacker is the user sending the request.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication.  
- This likely affects the security of resources beyond the vulnerable component (authentication mechanism).  
- Authentication bypass usually means the attacker can access resources they shouldn't.  
- This implies a **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Authentication bypass can lead to unauthorized access to data.  
- This implies at least **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Bypassing authentication can allow the attacker to perform actions as another user, potentially modifying data.  
- So, **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack over network via crafted cookie in HTTP request                    |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions or timing required                                 |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires active user session (authenticated user)                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction needed beyond attacker sending request               |
| Scope (S)            | C      | Authentication bypass affects resources beyond vulnerable component      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Unauthorized access to data possible                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Unauthorized modification of data possible                              |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability                                               |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator logic:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 8.22 * 0.274 ≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.1936)  
= 7.52 * 0.8064 ≈ 6.06

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= 1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)  
= 1.08 * (6.06 + 2.25)  
= 1.08 * 8.31 ≈ 8.97

Rounded up to one decimal place: **9.0**

#####920#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to control the destination URL of the HttpClient used in the API classes.
- This can lead to requests being made to unexpected resources on local networks or the internet.
- Potential impact: information disclosure.
- Mitigations: strict egress rules and input validation.
- Affected versions: before v1.6.0.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker can cause the HttpClient to send requests to arbitrary URLs, including local networks or internet resources.  
- The attacker likely exploits this remotely by controlling input to the SDK.  
- Therefore, the attack can be performed over the network.  
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to control or influence the destination URL used by the HttpClient.  
- The description mentions that strict validation and egress rules can mitigate the issue, implying that the attack requires some conditions but not very complex ones.  
- The attacker must supply or manipulate input to the SDK, but no advanced conditions or timing are mentioned.  
- This suggests **Low complexity**.  
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to supply input to the SDK, presumably as an unprivileged user or external actor.  
- No mention of needing any privileges on the system or network.  
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker controls the input to the SDK, so no user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  
- **UI = None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows the attacker to make requests to other resources, potentially outside the original security scope of the application.  
- However, the vulnerability is about controlling the destination URL of HttpClient within the same application context.  
- The impact is information disclosure from other resources, but the vulnerable component and impacted component are likely the same.  
- The description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact crossing security boundaries.  
- This suggests **Scope Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure by making requests to unexpected resources.  
- The impact is likely limited to some information disclosure, not full system compromise.  
- **Confidentiality = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
- The attacker can only cause requests to be sent, not modify data.  
- **Integrity = None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.  
- **Availability = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to exploit.                                                        |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact is within the same security scope.                                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Information disclosure possible.                                                          |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact.                                                                       |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact.                                                                    |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
≈ 8.22 × 0.476 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (1.41 + 3.91)  
= Round_up (5.32)  
= 5.3

- The function `CefVideoConsumerOSR::OnFrameCaptured` does not properly check `pixel_format`.
- This leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- The out-of-bounds read occurs out of the sandbox.
- Patched in a specific commit.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in a function related to video frame capture in an embedded browser framework.  
- Since CEF is embedded in applications, and the vulnerability involves a function that processes frames, the attack likely requires interaction with the application embedding CEF.  
- However, the description does not specify that the attacker must be local or adjacent.  
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in browser components are typically exploitable remotely via crafted content or data.  
- Therefore, **Network (N)** is the most appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to improper checking of `pixel_format`, leading to an out-of-bounds read.  
- This suggests a straightforward flaw without complex conditions.  
- No mention of special conditions or timing required.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a browser framework component.  
- Usually, such vulnerabilities can be triggered by unprivileged users (e.g., web content).  
- No mention that attacker needs privileges on the host system.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability involves frame capture in the embedded browser.  
- Typically, exploitation would require the user to visit a malicious page or load malicious content.  
- This implies user interaction is required.  
- So, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds read "out of the sandbox."  
- This suggests that the impact crosses a security boundary (sandbox to outside).  
- Therefore, the scope is **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure.  
- The description implies reading memory outside intended bounds, which can leak information.  
- So, **Low (L)** (not High because no indication of full system compromise or total data disclosure).

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability is a read-only out-of-bounds access.  
- No mention of modification or corruption of data.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of denial of service or crash impact.  
- Out-of-bounds read typically does not affect availability.  
- So, **None (N)**.

| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to exploit.                                                       |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | User must interact (e.g., visit page or load content).                                   |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Out-of-bounds read escapes sandbox, changing scope.                                      |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
  ≈ 2.25

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
  = 1 - (0.78 × 1 × 1)  
  = 1 - 0.78  
  = 0.22

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.22 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.22 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.191 - 3.25 × (0.2)^15  
  = 1.436 - 3.25 × very small number  
  ≈ 1.436 (since (0.2)^15 is negligible)

- Base Score (Scope Changed) =  
  If Impact ≤ 0, score = 0  
  Else score = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 × (1.436 + 2.25), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 × 3.686, 10))  
  = round_up(3.981)  
  = 3.98 → 4.0 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####922#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of the "Story" argument in message.php.
- Affected product: code-projects Social Networking Site 1.0.
- Attack vector: The attack may be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- XSS typically requires the attacker to send a crafted request over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- XSS usually has low complexity if the input is not sanitized.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker manipulates an argument in a web request.  
- No mention of needing to be authenticated or have privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS requires the victim to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a crafted page or click a link).  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the user.  
- Usually, this is considered Low impact on confidentiality because it can steal cookies or session tokens.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that may modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically considered Low impact on integrity.  
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack can be launched remotely over network.  |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions; low complexity.          |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required to exploit.              |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact (e.g., click link).        |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Vulnerability affects same security scope.      |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L      | Partial disclosure of information possible.     |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Partial modification possible via script.       |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No impact on availability.                       |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.51

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.51 + 2.25)  
= Round_up (4.76)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and assign values for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
The GiveWP WordPress plugin before 2.24.1 does not properly escape user input before it reaches SQL queries, which could let unauthenticated attackers perform SQL Injection attacks.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metric Values

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable by attackers over the network (e.g., via web requests).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection typically requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. No mention of complex conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description says "unauthenticated attackers," meaning no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly without requiring a user to perform any action.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the plugin, which is part of the WordPress application. SQL Injection typically allows impact beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., database compromise), but since the description does not specify a change in scope (e.g., from plugin to OS), we assume the scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized data disclosure. This is typically considered a High impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL Injection can allow modification of data. This is typically High impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL Injection can sometimes be used to delete or corrupt data, or cause denial of service. Usually considered High impact if the attacker can affect availability.  
  **Value:** High (H)

| I      | H     | High integrity impact (data modification) |
| A      | H     | High availability impact (data deletion or DoS) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score:** This combination typically results in a **9.8 (Critical)** score.

#####924#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Path traversal via manipulation of the argument `f` in `index.php`.
- Affects: unknown-o download-station up to version 1.1.8.
- Attack Vector: The attack may be initiated remotely.
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Impact: Path traversal can lead to unauthorized file access.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack can be initiated remotely.
- Path traversal via a web parameter (`f` in `index.php`).
- This implies the attacker can exploit it over the network.
- **AV = Network (N)**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is a path traversal via a parameter manipulation.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- The attacker just needs to supply a crafted input.
- **AC = Low (L)**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.
- The attacker can exploit it remotely without credentials.
- **PR = None (N)**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends a crafted request.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
- **UI = None (N)**

---

**Scope (S):**

- Path traversal typically allows access to files outside the intended directory.
- This can lead to impact beyond the vulnerable component.
- However, the description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact on other components.
- Usually, path traversal affects the same security scope (the web application).
- Unless the vulnerability affects other components or privileges, scope remains unchanged.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Path traversal can allow reading arbitrary files.
- This leads to unauthorized disclosure of information.
- The impact is more than none but may not be total system compromise.
- **C = High (H)** or **Low (L)**?

- Since path traversal can allow reading sensitive files, often considered **High** if sensitive files can be accessed.
- The description is vague, but since it's classified as critical, assume **High (H)**.

---

**Integrity (I):**

- Path traversal typically allows reading files, not modifying them.
- No mention of file modification or data tampering.
- **I = None (N)**

---

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of denial of service or availability impact.
- **A = None (N)**

---

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | Simple input manipulation |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Impact within same scope |
| C      | H     | Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or standard tables:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:H = 0.56
- I:N = 0.0
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
= 8.22 × 0.473  
≈ 3.89

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44 × 1 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.595

**Base Score (Scope Unchanged):**

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (3.595 + 3.89)  
= Round_up (7.485)  
= 7.5

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
"An OS command injection vulnerability has been reported to affect Photo Station. If exploited, the vulnerability could allow authenticated users to execute commands via a network."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability can be exploited via a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit. OS command injection vulnerabilities are typically straightforward if authentication is met.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "authenticated users," so some privileges are required, but not high-level privileges necessarily.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for exploitation. The attacker is authenticated and can execute commands via network.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows execution of OS commands, which likely affects the system beyond the vulnerable component itself. However, since the description does not explicitly mention a change in scope, and the vulnerability affects the same component (Photo Station), we assume scope is unchanged.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  OS command injection can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. Since the description does not specify data disclosure, but command execution can lead to some data exposure, assign Low (L).  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Command injection allows modification of system state or data. This is a direct impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Command injection can be used to disrupt service (e.g., by running commands that crash the system).  
  **Value:** High (H)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions mentioned |
| PR     | L     | Requires authenticated user |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | No indication of scope change |
| C      | L     | Possible data disclosure |
| I      | H     | Command execution impacts integrity |
| A      | H     | Command execution impacts availability |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 2.69

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 6 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 6 * 0.849 ≈ 5.09

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
= round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.09 + 2.69, 10))  
= round_up(7.78) = 7.8

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Totolink N350RT 9.3.5u.6139_B202012
- Affects function loginAuth in /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi
- Manipulation of argument http_host leads to stack-based buffer overflow
- Attack can be launched remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used
- Vendor did not respond

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- The vulnerable function is accessed via a CGI script, which implies network access.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument (http_host).  
- No mention of special conditions or timing requirements.  
- Usually, buffer overflow via HTTP argument manipulation is straightforward.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely by manipulating an HTTP argument.  
- No mention of needing any privileges or authentication.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack is launched remotely by sending a crafted request.  
- No mention that a user must interact or perform any action.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in a CGI script.  
- Usually, buffer overflows in a web application or CGI script can lead to code execution or system-level impact.  
- The description does not explicitly say the impact crosses privilege boundaries or affects other components beyond the vulnerable component.  
- However, since it is a buffer overflow in a network-facing component, it is likely that the scope is **Changed (C)** because the impact can affect the system beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, S = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Buffer overflow can lead to code execution or crash.  
- No explicit mention of data disclosure, but code execution can lead to full system compromise.  
- Usually, for critical buffer overflow, confidentiality impact is High (H).  
- So, C = High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow attacker to execute arbitrary code, modify data, or system files.  
- So, I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- So, A = High (H)

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Remote attack via network (HTTP request)                                                  |

| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required                                                                    |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction needed                                                                |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Impact likely affects system beyond vulnerable component                                  |

| Integrity (I)        | H     | Potential full system compromise                                                         |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Potential denial of service or crash                                                     |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.7225  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.5565  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.473  
  ≈ 3.89

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
  = 1 - 0.085  
  = 0.915

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.886 - 3.25 × (0.895)^15

Calculate (0.895)^15:  
≈ 0.895^15 ≈ 0.165 (approximate)

So:  
Impact ≈ 7.52 × 0.886 - 3.25 × 0.165  
= 6.66 - 0.54  
= 6.12

- Base Score (Scope Changed):  
  If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
  Else, Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 × (6.12 + 3.89), 10))  
  = round_up(min(1.08 × 10.01, 10))  
  = round_up(min(10.81, 10))  
  = round_up(10)  
  = 10.0

# Final answer:

Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  
Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  
Privileges Required (PR): None (N)

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####927#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in GetSimple CMS 3.3.16 exists when using Source Code Mode as a backend user to add articles via the /admin/edit.php page.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploited via the /admin/edit.php page, which is a web interface. Since it requires interaction with a web page, the attack is over the network.  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if the attacker can inject scripts easily.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The description states "when using Source Code Mode as a backend user," which implies the attacker must be authenticated as a backend user. This means some privileges are required, but not necessarily high privileges.  
  Backend user access is typically considered **Low** privileges (not full admin/root).  
  **PR = Low (L)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  For XSS, the attacker usually needs the victim to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., visit a crafted page). However, this is a stored XSS in the admin interface, so the attacker is the backend user adding articles, and the victim is another user who views the article. The attacker does not need user interaction to exploit, but the victim does need to view the malicious content.  
  Since the attacker is the backend user, and the attack requires the victim to view the injected script, **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the CMS application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  XSS can lead to disclosure of information (e.g., cookies, session tokens). This is typically considered a **Low** impact on confidentiality.  
  **C = Low (L)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  XSS can allow an attacker to modify or inject content, which affects integrity. This is usually considered **Low** impact.  
  **I = Low (L)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  XSS generally does not affect availability.  
  **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network (web interface) |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | L     | Requires backend user privileges (low) |
| UI     | R     | Victim must interact (view malicious content) |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same security scope |
| C      | L     | Information disclosure possible |
| I      | L     | Content can be modified (injected) |
| A      | N     | No impact on availability |

### Step 3: Construct the CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####928#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Delhivery Delhivery Logistics Courier. This issue affects Delhivery Logistics Courier: from n/a through 1.0.107.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** SQL Injection  
- **Effect:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

---

### Step 2: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
SQL Injection typically can be exploited remotely over the network, especially if the application is web-facing.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
SQL Injection usually requires low complexity if the input is not sanitized properly. No special conditions or timing required.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
SQL Injection often requires no privileges to exploit because it targets input fields accessible to unauthenticated users or users with minimal privileges. The description does not mention any authentication requirement.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
Exploitation of SQL Injection generally does not require user interaction beyond the attacker sending crafted input.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized disclosure of data. The impact is typically high because attackers can extract sensitive information.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
SQL Injection can allow attackers to modify or delete data, so integrity impact is high.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
SQL Injection can sometimes be used to delete data or cause denial of service, but this is less common or less severe than confidentiality and integrity impacts. However, since the description does not specify availability impact, but SQL Injection can cause availability issues, we will consider at least Low (L).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: L (Low)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

#####929#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Multiple TP-LINK products are vulnerable.  
- The attacker is network-adjacent (not remote over the internet, but on the same local network or logically adjacent).  
- The attacker must be authenticated.  
- The attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands (code execution).  

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is network-adjacent, not fully remote over the internet.  
- AV:A (Adjacent)  

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity.  
- The attacker must be authenticated, but that affects PR, not AC.  
- No indication of high complexity, so AC:L (Low)  

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated, so PR is not None.  
- The description does not specify the level of privileges required for authentication. Usually, "authenticated attacker" implies at least Low privileges (e.g., a normal user account).  
- So PR:L (Low)  

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker executes commands directly after authentication; no mention of needing user interaction.  
- UI:N (None)  

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary OS command execution.  
- This likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., the OS).  
- Usually, command execution vulnerabilities change scope because they affect the system beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S:C (Changed)  

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- So C:H (High)  

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution allows full modification of system files and data.  
- I:H (High)  

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., delete files, stop services).  
- A:H (High)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | A     | Network-adjacent attacker                       |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions, low complexity           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Authenticated attacker, low privileges          |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                     |
| Scope (S)            | C     | OS command execution affects system beyond component |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Full data disclosure possible                     |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Full system modification possible                 |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Full disruption possible                           |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) (0.68)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.68 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.77 × 0.68 × 0.85 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 × 0.915 ≈ 6.88

Since Scope is Changed:  
Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 2.82, 10])  
= Roundup (9.7) = 9.7

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####930#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Limit Login Attempts Reloaded plugin for WordPress (up to version 2.25.26)
- Cause: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied shortcode attributes
- Attackers: Authenticated users with contributor-level and above permissions
- Impact: Inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via shortcodes in WordPress pages.  
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface or contributor-level permissions, which implies local access to the web application interface, but the attack is performed over the network (HTTP requests).  
- Since the attacker interacts remotely via the web interface, the vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the required permissions.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor-level is a low privilege level in WordPress (not admin, but can create and edit content).  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges mean some privileges are required but not administrative.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the victim (user) to access the injected page for the script to execute.  
- The attacker injects the script, but the victim must view the page for the impact to occur.  
- Therefore, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the WordPress application).  
- The impact is limited to the application itself, no privilege escalation beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
- So, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the user.  
- This can lead to partial disclosure of information.  
- Usually, XSS is rated as **Low (L)** confidentiality impact unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject scripts that can modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This can be considered a partial integrity impact.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- No indication of denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- So, **None (N)**.

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack performed remotely over the network via web interface                              |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Straightforward exploitation, no special conditions                                       |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires contributor-level or above permissions (low privileges)                          |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must view the injected page for script execution                                   |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable component's security scope                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial disclosure of information possible via XSS                                       |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Partial modification of content or actions possible                                      |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                 |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Roundup (4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Affects: Photo Station
- Exploitation: Allows authenticated users to inject malicious code via a network
- User must be authenticated (implies privileges required)
- Attack vector: Network (since injection is via network)
- Impact: Injection of malicious code (usually impacts confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability to some extent)

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond authentication.  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if the attacker is authenticated.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated, so some privileges are required.  
- The description says "authenticated users," but does not specify if low or high privileges are needed. Usually, XSS in web apps requires low privileges (normal user).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS usually requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link) to trigger the malicious code.  
- The description does not explicitly say the attacker needs user interaction, but XSS typically requires the victim to interact.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities usually affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually, the impact is limited to low confidentiality impact unless specified otherwise.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS allows injection of malicious code, which can modify or inject content.  
- This is a low integrity impact (modification of data or code in the context of the user).  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not impact availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

- UI: R (Required)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: L (Low)  
- I: L (Low)

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62 ≈ 2.04

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.04) = round_up(4.55) = 4.6 (Medium severity)

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack possible |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact due to improper access control |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact possible |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 3.91, 10))  
= round_up(6.42)  
= 6.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####933#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Affected software: Formidable Forms WordPress plugin (up to version 6.7.2)
- Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can change form settings and add malicious JavaScript by tricking a site administrator into performing an action (clicking a link).
- Key points:
  - Attack requires tricking a site administrator (user interaction required).
  - Attacker is unauthenticated (Privileges Required: None).
  - Attack is performed remotely (via forged request).
  - Impact: ability to change settings and add malicious JavaScript (confidentiality, integrity, availability impact to be assessed).
  - Scope: Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component? Adding malicious JavaScript could affect the site and its users, but the description focuses on changing form settings and adding JS in the plugin context.

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed remotely via a forged request (CSRF).  
- The attacker does not need local access; the attack is over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires tricking a site administrator into clicking a link (user interaction required).  
- This is a typical CSRF scenario, which is generally considered low complexity because no special conditions beyond user interaction are needed.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is unauthenticated (no privileges).  
- However, the attack requires the victim to be an administrator (site administrator). The attacker does not have privileges but relies on the victim's privileges.  
- According to CVSS v3.1, PR is from the attacker's perspective, not the victim's. Since the attacker is unauthenticated, PR is None.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack requires the site administrator to perform an action (click a link).  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows changing form settings and adding malicious JavaScript.  
- The impact is on the same component (plugin) and the WordPress site itself.  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component?  
- Adding malicious JavaScript can affect the site and its users, which is outside the plugin component itself. This suggests the scope is Changed.  
- **Value: Changed (C)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can add malicious JavaScript, which could lead to data theft or further attacks.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but adding malicious JS can lead to confidentiality loss.  
- Given the direct impact is changing settings and adding JS, confidentiality impact is at least Low.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can change form settings and add malicious JavaScript, which is a direct integrity impact.  
- This is more than just a low impact; it is a high impact because the attacker can modify settings and inject code.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Availability (A):**  
- The description does not mention any denial of service or availability impact.  
- **Value: None (N)**

| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Requires site administrator to click a link.                                              |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Impact affects resources beyond the vulnerable component (site-wide impact).               |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Possible data exposure via malicious JS.                                                  |
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Settings and code can be modified by attacker.                                            |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact mentioned.                                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Calculate Impact Sub-Score:**

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.3432)  
= 7.52 * 0.6568  
= 4.94

**Calculate Exploitability Sub-Score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.274  
= 2.25 (approx)

**Calculate Base Score:**

Since Scope is Changed (C):

Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (4.94 + 2.25), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 7.19, 10))  
= round_up(min(7.76, 10))  
= 7.8

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that run in the context of the victim's browser.  
- **Attack Vector:** Usually, reflected XSS is exploitable over the network (via HTTP requests).  
- **Privileges Required:** None, since the attacker just needs to send a crafted request.  
- **User Interaction:** Required, because the victim must click a link or visit a crafted URL for the script to execute.  
- **Scope:** Usually unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application).  
- **Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:**  
  - Confidentiality: Low (attacker can steal cookies or session tokens)  
  - Integrity: Low (attacker can modify the content seen by the user)  
  - Availability: None (XSS typically does not affect availability)

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  The attack is performed remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reflected XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending a crafted request.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the system.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  The victim must interact (e.g., click a link).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability affects resources managed by the same security authority.

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Attacker can steal some information (e.g., cookies).

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  Attacker can modify the content displayed to the user.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  No impact on availability.

|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable over the network                    |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges needed                             |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | Victim must interact (click link)               |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Same security scope                              |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial disclosure of information                |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Partial modification of content                   |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                         |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
≈ 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
≈ 8.22 * 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916  
≈ 2.52

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.52 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(4.77)  
= 4.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44) = 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.5952

#####936#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Tenda AC10U firmware versions 15.03.06.48/15.03.06.49.
- Affects function `formSetSambaConf` in `/goform/setsambacfg`.
- Manipulation of the argument `usbName` leads to OS command injection.
- Attack may be initiated remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Rated as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- "The attack may be initiated remotely."
- The vulnerability is in a router firmware web interface (`/goform/setsambacfg`), likely accessible over the network.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is an OS command injection via argument manipulation.
- No mention of special conditions or complex steps.
- Usually, command injection via web parameters is low complexity.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The description does not mention needing any privileges.
- The attack is initiated remotely, presumably unauthenticated.
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable function.
- No mention of requiring user interaction.
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability is OS command injection on the device.
- The vulnerable component is part of the system itself.
- Command injection affects the system beyond the vulnerable component.
- This usually means Scope is Changed (C) because the impact crosses privilege boundaries or components.
- Therefore, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- OS command injection can lead to full system compromise.
- This implies total loss of confidentiality.
- Therefore, C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**

- OS command injection allows arbitrary command execution.
- This implies total loss of integrity.
- Therefore, I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- OS command injection can lead to system crash or denial of service.
- Therefore, A = High (H).

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:N (Network)
- AC:L (Low)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:N (None)
- S:C (Changed)
- C:H (High)
- I:H (High)
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:C
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**

Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))

= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))

= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)

= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)

= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

If Impact > 0:

BaseScore = RoundUp (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

= RoundUp (6.88 + 3.89) = RoundUp (10.77) = 10.0 (max)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Mapster Technology Inc. Mapster WP Maps allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Mapster WP Maps: from n/a through 1.2.38.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in a web application plugin.  
- XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via a crafted HTTP request).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stored XSS usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input that is stored and later rendered.  
- No special environment or timing conditions are mentioned.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker typically does not need any privileges to inject stored XSS payloads in a web application input field.  
- The description does not mention any authentication or privileges required.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For stored XSS, the attacker injects malicious script that is later executed in the victim's browser when they view the page.  
- The victim (user) must visit or load the affected page for the script to execute.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required (the victim must view the page).  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- The vulnerability does not appear to escalate privileges or affect other components beyond the vulnerable web app.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information accessible to the browser.  
- This results in at least a Low impact on confidentiality.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying or injecting content.  
- This can be considered a Low impact on integrity (modification of data or content).  
- Therefore, I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- Therefore, A = None (N).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
≈ 8.22 * 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact:**  
= 6.42 * Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.34) = 5.4

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####938#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Null pointer dereference while parsing specially crafted SPP files.  
- Impact: Crash the application causing denial of service (DoS).  
- Affected software: Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2201 (all versions), V2302 (all versions < V2302.0007).  
- Attack vector: The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted files (SPP files).  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing specially crafted files.  
- The files are likely opened locally or received from an external source.  
- Since the files are parsed by the application, the attacker must have a way to get the file to the victim.  
- No indication that this can be exploited remotely over a network without user interaction.  
- Usually, parsing a file implies local or adjacent vector.  
- If the attacker can send the file over the network and the application automatically parses it, AV:N would be possible. But no such indication here.  
- More likely, the attacker needs to provide the file locally or via adjacent means (e.g., removable media).  
- Since the description does not specify network exploitation, **AV:L (Local)** is appropriate.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted files.  
- No mention of complex conditions or environment.  
- Null pointer dereference is usually straightforward to trigger with crafted input.  
- Therefore, **AC:L (Low)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No mention that the attacker needs any privileges.  
- The attacker just needs to provide a crafted file to the application.  
- So, **PR:N (None)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The application parses the file.  
- The user must open or load the specially crafted file for the vulnerability to be triggered.  
- This implies user interaction is required.  
- So, **UI:R (Required)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes a crash of the application.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- So, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability causes denial of service, no mention of data disclosure.  
- So, **C:N (None)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of data modification or corruption.  
- So, **I:N (None)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability causes a denial of service (application crash).  
- This impacts availability.  
- The impact is likely high because the application crashes.  
- So, **A:H (High)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Base Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Requires local file to be opened |
| AC     | L     | Simple to trigger with crafted file |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must open/load the file |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | Application crash causes high availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.223  
≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 1 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44)  
= 6.42 × 0.56  
= 3.59

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.83, 10))  
= round_up(5.42)  
= 5.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)  
- Affected product: Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin (up to version 1.1.30)  
- Impact: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation allows stored XSS.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Stored XSS in a WordPress plugin is typically exploitable remotely over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stored XSS usually requires the attacker to submit malicious input that is stored and later rendered. This is generally straightforward and does not require special conditions.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Usually, stored XSS in WordPress plugins can be exploited by unauthenticated users submitting input (e.g., via comment forms or login forms).  
- The description does not mention any authentication requirement.  
- PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- For stored XSS, the victim must view the page containing the malicious script for the exploit to succeed.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- Stored XSS affects the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). It does not affect other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, resulting in some confidentiality impact.  
- Usually, this is considered Low (L) because it depends on the victim's interaction and the data exposed.  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to execute scripts that modify content or perform actions on behalf of the user, impacting integrity.  
- This is generally Low (L) impact.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | Victim must view malicious content |
| S      | U     | Vulnerability affects same scope |
| C      | L     | Some confidentiality impact possible |
| I      | L     | Some integrity impact possible |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:L (0.22)  
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore (ISC_Base) = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact = 6.42 * ISC_Base**  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(2.51 + 2.82, 10)) = round_up(5.33) = 5.4

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected software: Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) version 1.0
- Location: /cupseasylive/currencylist.php, description parameter
- Impact: Remote attacker sends a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user, potentially stealing session cookies.
- Key points:
  - Requires user interaction (the user must click the malicious URL)
  - Requires the user to be authenticated (implies some privileges)
  - Attack is remote (via URL)
  - Impact: theft of session cookies (confidentiality impact)
  - No mention of integrity or availability impact

---

### Step 1: Assign Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker sends a specially crafted URL remotely.  
- The attack is over the network (web).  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires crafting a URL and the user to click it.  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond user interaction.  
- This is typical for XSS and considered low complexity.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker targets an authenticated user, so the victim must have some privileges (logged-in user).  
- The attacker does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must be authenticated.  
- For CVSS, PR is from the attacker's perspective. The attacker does not need privileges on the system, but the victim must be authenticated.  
- Since the attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be authenticated, PR is **None (N)** because the attacker does not need privileges on the vulnerable system.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must click the specially crafted URL.  
- **Value: Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value: Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can steal session cookies, which is a confidentiality breach.  
- This is a high confidentiality impact because session cookies can lead to account takeover.  
- **Value: High (H)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the attacker can modify data or cause integrity loss.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of availability impact.  
- **Value: None (N)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.595

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [3.595 + 2.836, 10])  
= Roundup (6.431)  
= 6.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IceHrm 23.0.0.OS has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient encoding of user-controlled input in multiple parameters of a web page (/icehrm/app/fileupload_page.php). An attacker can send a specially crafted JavaScript payload to partially hijack the victim's browser.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted payload over the web (HTTP request).  
- This means the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker only needs to send a crafted payload; no special conditions or timing required.  
- This is a typical reflected/stored XSS scenario with low complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.  
- The attack is performed by sending input to a web page.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attack involves hijacking the victim's browser, which implies the victim must interact (e.g., visit the malicious link or page).  
- So, user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application).  
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**

- This implies some confidentiality impact, but not full system compromise.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially modifying data or actions performed by the user.  
- This implies some integrity impact.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS typically does not impact availability.  
- No indication of availability impact in the description.  
- **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.88

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.88 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.77) = 9.8 → 9.8 rounds to 9.8 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

#####943#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
The CommentTweets WordPress plugin through 0.6 does not have CSRF checks in some places, which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed via CSRF, which requires the attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing an action. The attacker does not need local or physical access; the attack can be done remotely over the network (e.g., via a crafted web page).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks generally require the attacker to lure a user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious page, but no special conditions or timing are required beyond that. This is considered low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges themselves, but the attack requires the victim user to be logged in (i.e., have privileges). The attacker acts without privileges, but the victim must have some. According to CVSS v3.1, PR is from the attacker's perspective. Since the attacker does not need privileges on the system, PR is None (N).  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim user to perform some action, such as clicking a link or visiting a malicious page.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the user perform unwanted actions within the same security scope (the WordPress plugin). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention any data disclosure or information leak. The attacker can perform actions but not necessarily read confidential data.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can cause unwanted actions to be performed by the user, which can modify data or state. This implies at least a Low impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  There is no mention of denial of service or impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack can be performed over the network |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions required |
| PR     | N     | Attacker requires no privileges |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (click link) |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Unwanted actions can modify data |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)])**  
= 6.42 * (1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0)])  
= 6.42 * (1 - [1 * 0.78 * 1])  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(4.24)  
= 4.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N**

#####944#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability type: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- Affected component: J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX and EX Series.
- Attack vector: An attacker constructs a malicious URL that, when visited by another user, executes commands with the target user's permissions, including administrator.
- The vulnerability involves the emit_debug_note method echoing back attacker-controlled data.
- The attacker does not need to be on the local machine; the attack is performed remotely by tricking a user into visiting a URL.
- The attacker gains the ability to execute commands with the target user's permissions (including admin).
- No mention of needing prior privileges or authentication.
- The attack requires the victim user to visit the malicious URL (user interaction required).
- The scope is likely unchanged because the vulnerability allows execution of commands within the same security scope (the web application or user context).
- Impact: The attacker can execute commands with the victim's privileges, including administrator, so confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts are likely high.

---

### Metric-by-metric analysis:

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attacker crafts a URL and sends it to the victim.
- The victim must visit the URL over the network.
- Therefore, the attack is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Value:** Network (N)

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker needs to construct a malicious URL.
- No mention of any special conditions or environment requirements.
- The attack is straightforward: just trick the user into clicking a URL.
- No complex conditions or timing required.

**Value:** Low (L)

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system.
- The attacker only needs to send a URL to a victim.
- The victim's privileges are what matter, but the attacker has none.

**Value:** None (N)

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The victim must visit the malicious URL.
- This requires user interaction.

**Value:** Required (R)

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows execution of commands with the victim's permissions.
- The description says "including an administrator," but it does not mention privilege escalation beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.
- The vulnerability affects the web application and the commands execute with the victim's permissions.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.

**Value:** Unchanged (U)

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can execute commands with the victim's permissions.
- This likely allows access to sensitive information.
- Since the attacker can execute commands as an admin, confidentiality impact is High.

**Value:** High (H)

---

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can execute commands with the victim's permissions.
- This allows modification of data, so integrity impact is High.

**Value:** High (H)

---

**Availability (A):**

- The attacker can execute commands with the victim's permissions.
- This could include deleting files, stopping services, etc.
- Availability impact is High.

**Value:** High (H)

---

### Summary of metric values:

- AV:N (Network)
- AC:L (Low)
- PR:N (None)
- UI:R (Required)
- S:U (Unchanged)
- C:H (High)
- I:H (High)
- A:H (High)

---

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:H = 0.56
- I:H = 0.56
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability sub-score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25 (approx)

**Impact sub-score:**

Impact = 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.085)  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
≈ 5.87

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 2.25, 10))  
= round_up(8.12)  
= 8.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####945#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Out-of-bounds access vulnerability in the device authentication module. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect confidentiality."

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in the "device authentication module." This suggests the vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network (e.g., during authentication). Since no indication suggests local or physical access is required, and authentication modules are typically network-facing, **AV:N (Network)** is appropriate.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  No mention of special conditions or complexity. Out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities are often straightforward to exploit if reachable. So, **AC:L (Low)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Since this is in the authentication module, and the description does not mention needing any privileges, it likely requires **PR:N (None)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required. Exploitation likely does not require user interaction. So, **UI:N (None)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects confidentiality, but no indication that the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope. Usually, out-of-bounds access in a module affects the same scope. So, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description explicitly states "may affect confidentiality." Since it is not specified as total data disclosure, but some impact, **C:L (Low)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of integrity impact. So, **I:N (None)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact. So, **A:N (None)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network accessible authentication module |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions mentioned |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable component |
| C      | L     | Confidentiality impact mentioned |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact mentioned |
| A      | N     | No availability impact mentioned |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:N = 0.85
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:N = 0.00
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78) = 6.42 * 0.22 = 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.91, 10)) = round_up(5.32) = 5.3

#####946#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"An issue discovered in OpenDroneID OSM 3.5.1 allows attackers to impersonate other drones via transmission of crafted data packets."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attack is performed by transmitting crafted data packets. This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity. Crafting data packets to impersonate drones suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker impersonates other drones by sending crafted packets, implying no prior privileges on the system are needed.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack involves sending crafted packets, no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows impersonation of other drones, which likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., other drones or systems relying on drone identity). This suggests the scope is changed.  
  **Value:** Changed (C)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Impersonation may allow access to information or data meant for the impersonated drone. This suggests some confidentiality impact, but not total data disclosure.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Impersonation means the attacker can send false data or commands, affecting integrity. This is likely a high impact on integrity because the attacker can fully impersonate another drone.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description does not mention any impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

#####947#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Allegro RomPager 4.01.
- Issue: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via manipulation of the "username" argument in an HTTP POST request.
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Affects HTTP POST Request Handler.
- No mention of authentication required.
- No mention of user interaction explicitly, but CSRF inherently requires user interaction (victim must visit a malicious page).
- No explicit mention of impact severity, but CSRF typically allows unauthorized actions, potentially affecting integrity and possibly availability or confidentiality depending on the action.
- Vendor fixed it in version 4.30.
- The issue is old and was fixed 20 years ago.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is launched remotely via HTTP POST request.
- Network access is required.
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious page.
- However, the description does not mention authentication or other complexities.
- CSRF attacks are generally considered low complexity because the attacker only needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious page.
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated (have privileges) because the attack leverages the victim's session.
- The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must have some.
- According to CVSS v3.1, PR is from the attacker's perspective.
- Since the attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be authenticated, PR is **Low (L)** if the attacker needs the victim to be authenticated.
- The description does not explicitly say if authentication is required, but CSRF inherently requires victim authentication.
- So, **PR:L (Low)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- CSRF requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page).
- So, **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the vulnerable component).
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- So, **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- CSRF typically does not directly disclose information.
- The description does not mention confidentiality impact.
- So, **C:N (None)**

**Integrity (I):**

- CSRF allows unauthorized actions, which can modify data.
- So, **I:L (Low)** (since the impact is limited to unauthorized actions, but not full control)

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of availability impact.
- So, **A:N (None)**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack via HTTP POST |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, attacker only needs to trick user |
| PR     | L     | Attacker requires victim to be authenticated (low privileges) |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required (victim must visit malicious page) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Integrity impact due to unauthorized actions |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:N = 0.00
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.62

= 8.22 * 0.85 = 6.987

6.987 * 0.77 = 5.380

5.380 * 0.62 = 3.336

3.336 * 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))

= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)

= 6.42 * 0.22

= 1.412

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

= round_up(min(1.412 + 2.068, 10))

= round_up(3.48)

= 3.5 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
A denial of service vulnerability has been found on Hex Workshop affecting version 6.7, an attacker could send a command line file arguments and control the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) records resulting in a service shutdown.

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker sends command line file arguments. This implies local access to the system (e.g., running the program with crafted arguments).  
  **Value:** Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker just needs to send crafted command line arguments to trigger the issue. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker needs to run the program with crafted arguments. Running a program usually requires at least user-level privileges, but no indication that elevated privileges are needed.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker controls the command line arguments directly, so no additional user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes a service shutdown by controlling SEH records. This likely affects the same security scope (the application itself), no indication that it affects other components or privileges outside the vulnerable component.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))**  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.41) = 5.4

Rounded to one decimal place, the Base Score is **5.4** (Medium severity).

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A phishing site could have repurposed an `about:` dialog to show phishing content with an incorrect origin in the address bar. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122 and Thunderbird < 115.7.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- The issue is that a phishing site can repurpose an internal dialog (`about:` dialog) to display phishing content.
- The phishing content shows an incorrect origin in the address bar, potentially misleading users.
- This is a phishing attack vector, which usually involves tricking users.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox and Thunderbird, which are network-facing applications.
- The attacker is a phishing site, so the attack likely happens over the network.
- The user must interact with the phishing site (user interaction required).
- The vulnerability allows spoofing the origin, which impacts **Confidentiality** (users can be tricked into revealing info), **Integrity** (users may be misled), and possibly **Availability** (less likely).
- However, the main impact is on user trust and confidentiality of information.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is a phishing site, so the attack is over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack involves repurposing an `about:` dialog to show phishing content with an incorrect origin.  
- This is a straightforward phishing attack, no special conditions or environment needed.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker is a phishing site, no privileges on the victim's machine are needed.  
- **PR:N (None)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The user must visit the phishing site and interact with the dialog.  
- **UI:R (Required)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the browser's UI and the origin shown in the address bar.  
- The impact is within the same security scope (browser process).  
- No privilege escalation or cross-component impact.  
- **S:U (Unchanged)**

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The phishing site can trick users into revealing sensitive information.  
- This is a partial impact on confidentiality (low).  
- **C:L (Low)**

**Integrity (I):**  
- The phishing content can mislead users, but it does not modify data or code.  
- This is a partial impact on integrity (low).  
- **I:L (Low)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No impact on availability is described.  
- **A:N (None)**

---

### Step 3: Summary of metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network (phishing site) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, no special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User interaction required (user visits phishing site) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged (within browser) |
| C      | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (phishing) |
| I      | L     | Partial integrity impact (misleading content) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85
- UI:R = 0.62
- S:U
- C:L = 0.22
- I:L = 0.22
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.6084)  
= 6.42 * 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.82) = round_up(5.33) = 5.3

  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Heap corruption can lead to information disclosure, but the description does not explicitly mention data leakage. Given the severity is "High," some confidentiality impact is likely.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Heap corruption can allow an attacker to modify memory, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation. This implies at least a low integrity impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  Heap corruption can cause crashes or denial of service. This implies at least a low availability impact.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.344 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.474)  
= 6.42 * 0.526 ≈ 3.38

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.38 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(6.21)  
= 6.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####951#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Open Redirect vulnerability in FireEye HXTool affecting version 4.6, the exploitation of which could allow an attacker to redirect a legitimate user to a malicious page by changing the 'redirect_uri' parameter.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability involves redirecting a user by manipulating a URL parameter. This can be exploited remotely over the network (e.g., via a crafted URL).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker only needs to change the 'redirect_uri' parameter to exploit the vulnerability. This is straightforward and does not require special conditions.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the system; they just need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The user must click or be redirected via a crafted link, so user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the application itself). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Open Redirect does not directly disclose confidential information.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The vulnerability does not allow modification of data or code.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability does not impact availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N  
- AC:L  
- PR:N  
- UI:R  
- S:U  
- C:N  
- I:N  
- A:N

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.82

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)) = 0

Since Impact Subscore = 0, the Base Score is the minimum of (Impact + Exploitability) and 10, but if Impact = 0, the Base Score is 0.

**However, per CVSS v3.1 specification, if Impact Subscore = 0, the Base Score is 0.**

---

### Final conclusion:

- The vulnerability is an Open Redirect, which does not impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability.  
- Therefore, the CVSS Base Score is **0.0** despite the ease of exploitation.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Code-projects Simple School Management System 1.0 allows SQL Injection via the 'pass' parameter at School/teacher_login.php.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable via a web parameter (`pass` parameter at a PHP page). This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  SQL Injection via a parameter usually requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. No mention of any special conditions or timing.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is exploiting a login parameter, presumably without needing any prior privileges. The attacker is likely unauthenticated.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is directly sending the malicious input; no user interaction is required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability is in the web application itself, and the impact is on the same security scope (the application). No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized data disclosure. Usually, this is considered a High impact on confidentiality because it can expose sensitive data.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  SQL Injection can allow modification of data. This is typically considered High impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  SQL Injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but this is less common or less certain. Since the description does not mention DoS, we assume no impact on availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N**

#####953#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's KVM arm64 vgic-its component.
- A potential Use-After-Free (UAF) condition in the LPI translation cache.
- The issue arises due to a race condition involving cache hits and invalidation commands.
- The problem is related to reference counting and locking in kernel code.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is in the kernel's virtual interrupt controller for ARM64 KVM.  
- Exploitation likely requires interaction with the virtualized environment or guest VM.  
- Since this is a kernel component related to virtualization, the attack can be triggered remotely from a guest VM or possibly locally on the host.  
- However, since KVM is a hypervisor and the issue is in the kernel module, the attacker likely needs to be on the guest VM or local system.  
- Given the nature of KVM and virtualization, the attack vector is **Local (L)** because the attacker must have local access to the system or guest VM to trigger the race condition.  
- It is unlikely to be Network (N) because this is not a network service exposed externally.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability involves a race condition (timing-dependent).  
- Race conditions are generally considered **High (H)** complexity because they require precise timing and conditions to exploit.  
- So, AC = High (H).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker needs to interact with the KVM virtualized environment.  
- Usually, to interact with KVM and trigger such conditions, the attacker needs at least some privileges on the guest VM or host.  
- Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker likely needs to be a user on the guest VM or host with some privileges.  
- Given that the vulnerability is in the virtual interrupt controller, the attacker likely needs **Low (L)** privileges (e.g., unprivileged user in guest VM) to trigger the issue.  
- So, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The vulnerability is a race condition in kernel code triggered by operations on the virtual interrupt controller.  
- No user interaction is required beyond the attacker triggering the condition.  
- So, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the kernel component (host) but is triggered from the guest VM.  
- The impact crosses privilege boundaries from guest VM to host kernel.  
- This means the scope is **Changed (C)** because the vulnerability allows impact beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- So, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Use-After-Free can lead to information disclosure if memory is read after being freed.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but UAF can lead to information leaks.  
- Given the potential, assign **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- UAF can allow modification of memory or control flow, potentially leading to integrity compromise.  
- The description mentions queueing interrupts and refcount manipulation, which could allow integrity impact.  
- Assign **Low (L)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- UAF can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- The description does not explicitly mention DoS, but UAF often can cause system instability.  
- Assign **Low (L)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required (guest VM or host) |
| AC     | H     | Race condition exploitation is complex |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges needed on guest or host |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security scope (guest to host) |
| C      | L     | Potential information disclosure |
| I      | L     | Potential integrity impact |
| A      | L     | Potential availability impact (crash) |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.44 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.31

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - (0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78)  
= 1 - 0.474 ≈ 0.526

Impact = 7.52 * (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 * (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.526 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.506)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.497 - negligible (very small)  
≈ 3.74

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, Base Score = Roundup(Min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= 1.08 * (3.74 + 1.31) = 1.08 * 5.05 = 5.45 → 5.5 (rounded up)

#####954#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Uncontrolled search path element (DLL hijacking).
- Impact: Privilege escalation to SYSTEM (high privileges).
- Attack scenarios:
  1. Locally authenticated adversary escalates privileges.
  2. Attacker hosts trojanized software and tricks victims into installing it, gaining initial access and code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker can either be local (for privilege escalation) or remote (by tricking victims to download/install trojanized software).  
- Since the attacker can gain initial access remotely by social engineering (tricking victims to install malicious software), the attack vector includes Network (N).  
- The privilege escalation requires local access, but initial access can be remote.  
- CVSS uses the most favorable vector for the attacker, so AV:N (Network).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker needs to trick victims into installing malicious software (social engineering), which is not complex but requires user interaction.  
- The local privilege escalation is straightforward once local access is obtained.  
- Overall, the attack complexity is Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- For the privilege escalation path, the attacker must be locally authenticated (Low or High privileges). The description says "locally authenticated adversary," which implies at least Low privileges.  
- For the initial access via trojanized software, no privileges are required (None).  
- Since the attacker can gain initial access with no privileges (via social engineering), PR is None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker must trick victims into downloading and installing malicious software, which requires user interaction.  
- For the privilege escalation path, no user interaction is needed once local access is obtained.  
- Since the attack vector includes the trojanized software path, UI is Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows escalation to SYSTEM privileges, which is a different security authority than the initial user.  
- This means the scope is Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Privilege escalation to SYSTEM implies full access to confidential information.  
- Confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- SYSTEM privileges allow full control, so integrity is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- SYSTEM privileges also allow disruption of availability.  
- Availability impact is High (H).

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) [Scope Changed]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
≈ 2.25

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 7.52 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 7.52 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 × 0.915  
≈ 6.88

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (Minimum [6.88 + 2.25, 10])  
= Roundup (9.13)  
= 9.1

- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.87

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 3.87, 10))  
= round_up(9.74) = 9.7

#####956#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in Apache Solr (versions 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, and 9.0.0 before 9.4.1).
- Allows unrestricted upload of Java jar and class files via ConfigSets API.
- If backup is saved to a directory used by Solr's ClassPath/ClassLoaders, these files can be executed by any ConfigSet, including untrusted ones.
- When Solr is run with Authorization enabled (recommended), the vulnerability is limited to users with Backup permissions.
- This means an attacker must have Backup permissions to exploit this.
- Exploitation could lead to execution of arbitrary code (implied by "inclusion of functionality from untrusted control sphere").
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the ConfigSets API.
- No mention of user interaction required.
- Impact likely affects Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability due to arbitrary code execution.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The vulnerability is exploitable via the ConfigSets API, which is a network service.
- The attacker can upload files remotely.
- **AV = Network (N)**

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The attacker needs to upload malicious jar/class files and save backups to specific directories used by ClassLoader.
- This requires some knowledge and specific conditions but no special environment or timing.
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing constraints.
- **AC = Low (L)**

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- The vulnerability is limited to users with Backup permissions when Authorization is enabled.
- Backup permission is required to exploit.
- Backup permission is a specific privilege, not "None".
- The description does not specify if Backup permission is low or high privilege.
- Backup permission is likely a low privilege compared to full admin.
- **PR = Low (L)**

#### User Interaction (UI)
- No mention of user interaction required.
- The attacker uploads files and triggers backup.
- **UI = None (N)**

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code via uploaded files.
- This affects the Solr server beyond the vulnerable component (ConfigSets API).
- The impact crosses privilege boundaries and affects other components.
- This suggests the scope is changed.
- **S = Changed (C)**

#### Confidentiality (C)
- Arbitrary code execution can lead to full data disclosure.
- Likely high impact on confidentiality.
- **C = High (H)**

#### Integrity (I)
- Arbitrary code execution allows modification of data.
- **I = High (H)**

#### Availability (A)
- Arbitrary code execution can disrupt service.
- **A = High (H)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.274  
  ≈ 2.25

- Impact Sub-Score (Scope Changed):

  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
  = 1 - [0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44]  
  = 1 - 0.085  
  = 0.915

  Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.915 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.915 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.886 - 3.25 × (0.895)^15  
  = 6.66 - 3.25 × 0.142  
  = 6.66 - 0.46  
  = 6.20

- Base Score = Roundup(Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
  = Roundup(Min[6.20 + 2.25, 10])

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in RRJ Nueva Ecija Engineer Online Portal 1.0
- Affects /admin/edit_teacher.php, component Add Enginer
- Manipulation of Firstname/Lastname argument leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Attack can be initiated remotely
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be initiated remotely.  
- Since it is a web application vulnerability exploitable over the network, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via manipulation of input parameters.  
- Usually, XSS vulnerabilities have low complexity if no special conditions are required.  
- No mention of special conditions or complex steps.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability is in a web portal's admin page (/admin/edit_teacher.php).  
- The description does not explicitly say if authentication is required.  
- However, the path is /admin/, which often requires authentication.  
- But the description says "The attack can be initiated remotely" without specifying if authentication is needed.  
- Since it is not explicitly stated, but the path is /admin/, it is likely that some privileges are required.  
- Let's assume Low privileges required (L) because the attacker might need to be logged in as a low-privilege user or authenticated user.  
- If it required no privileges, it would be explicitly stated.  
- So PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- XSS usually requires the victim to interact with a malicious link or content.  
- The attacker manipulates input parameters, but the victim must load the malicious content for the XSS to execute.  
- Therefore, user interaction is required.  
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the web application).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- Usually, XSS leads to Low confidentiality impact unless it allows full data disclosure.  
- So C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow an attacker to inject scripts that modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This can be considered Low impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not affect availability.  
- A = None (N).

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required.                                                           |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Likely requires some privileges (admin page), but not high.                               |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact with malicious content for XSS to execute.                           |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope.                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | XSS can disclose some sensitive information.                                              |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | XSS can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.                             |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability.                                                                |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
≈ 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged (U):

Base Score = Round_up (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Round_up (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Round_up (4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description:

**CVE Description:**  
flusity-CMS v2.33 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /core/tools/add_translation.php.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability type and context

- **Vulnerability type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Affected component:** /core/tools/add_translation.php
- **Impact:** CSRF typically allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a request that performs some action without their consent.

---

### Step 2: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network since the attacker tricks the user into submitting a request via their browser.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious site or click a crafted link. This is a common and straightforward attack method, so the complexity is low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need privileges on the target system, but the victim must be authenticated (have privileges). The attacker exploits the victim's privileges. According to CVSS v3.1, if the attacker does not need privileges but the victim does, PR is None (N).  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must perform some action, such as visiting a malicious website or clicking a link, to trigger the CSRF.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  CSRF vulnerabilities typically affect the same security scope (the vulnerable web application). The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  CSRF can allow unauthorized actions, but usually does not directly disclose confidential information. However, depending on the action, it might lead to some data exposure. Since the description does not mention data disclosure, assume Low (L) or None (N).  
  Given the action is "add_translation.php," likely modifying data rather than reading confidential data. So, Confidentiality impact is None (N).

- **Integrity (I):**  
  CSRF can cause unauthorized changes, so there is an integrity impact. Adding translations modifies data.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Availability (A):**  
  CSRF usually does not affect availability. No indication of availability impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No data disclosure indicated                                                              |
| Integrity (I)        | L      | Unauthorized modification of data (adding translations)                                   |
| Availability (A)     | N      | No availability impact indicated                                                          |

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.84

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 1 × 0.78 × 1)  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22  
= 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.84, 10))  
= round_up(4.25)  
= 4.3 (rounded to one decimal place)

#####959#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability in SAP Application Interface Framework File Adapter version 702.  
- A **high privilege user** can execute OS commands via a function module.  
- This allows control over the application behavior.  
- Leads to considerable impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack requires a **high privilege user** to invoke a function module.  
- Since the attacker must already have access to the application (likely via network or local access), but the description does not specify physical access or adjacency.  
- Usually, SAP applications are accessed over the network, but the attacker must be a high privilege user inside the system.  
- Because the attacker is a high privilege user, it implies local or network access with credentials.  
- Given the attacker is a user of the application, and the attack is through a function module, this is likely **Local (L)** or **Network (N)**.  
- However, since the attacker is a user of the application (not necessarily local OS access), and SAP applications are networked, the attack vector is likely **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker is a high privilege user and can use a function module to execute OS commands.  
- No special conditions or timing required are mentioned.  
- The attack seems straightforward for a high privilege user.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a **high privilege user**.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention any need for other users to interact.  
- The attacker is the user executing the function module.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The attacker can execute OS commands, which affects the underlying system beyond the vulnerable component.  
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The attacker can control the application behavior and execute OS commands.  
- This leads to considerable impact on confidentiality.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can execute OS commands, which can modify data and system state.  
- Considerable impact on integrity.  
- So, **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The attacker can affect availability considerably.  
- So, **High (H)**.

### Step 3: CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**

#####960#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via shortcode in a WordPress plugin.
- Affected versions: up to 4.14.3.
- Cause: insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
- Attackers: authenticated users with contributor-level and above permissions.
- Impact: injection of arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via a shortcode.
- The injection happens through the web interface (WordPress plugin).
- The attacker must have contributor-level access and above, so the attacker is local to the application but the attack is performed over the network (HTTP requests).
- In CVSS, if the attack can be performed remotely over the network, AV is Network (N).
- Since the attacker must be authenticated and interact with the web interface, but the attack is performed remotely over the network, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping.
- The attacker must have contributor-level permissions and know how to inject the payload.
- No special conditions or timing required.
- This is a straightforward stored XSS.
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.
- Contributor-level is a low privilege role in WordPress (not admin).
- So PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires a victim user to access the injected page for the script to execute.
- So user interaction is required.
- UI = Required (R).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows script execution in the context of the vulnerable plugin/page.
- The impact is on the same security scope (the WordPress application).
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.
- Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Stored XSS can lead to disclosure of sensitive information accessible to the victim user.
- Usually, stored XSS is rated as Low (L) confidentiality impact because it can steal cookies, session tokens, or other data accessible to the victim.
- So C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying content or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- This is a Low (L) integrity impact because the attacker can modify data or perform actions but not fully control the system.
- I = Low (L).

**Availability (A):**

- Stored XSS generally does not impact availability.
- No indication of denial of service or availability impact.
- A = None (N).

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack performed remotely over the network |
| AC     | L     | Straightforward exploit, no special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Requires contributor-level privileges |
| UI     | R     | Victim must interact with injected content |
| S      | U     | Impact within the same security scope |
| C      | L     | Disclosure of information possible |
| I      | L     | Modification of content or actions possible |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####961#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
The WordPress Toolbar WordPress plugin through 2.2.6 redirects to any URL via the "wptbto" parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability involves redirecting users via a URL parameter. The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network (e.g., by sending a crafted URL).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to trick users into performing an action (clicking a link). This requires some user interaction but no special conditions or environment constraints. The complexity is low.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is unauthenticated, so no privileges are required.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker must trick the user into clicking a malicious link (performing an action).  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the WordPress plugin). It does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The vulnerability is an open redirect. It does not disclose or leak confidential information.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The vulnerability does not allow modification of data or code.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability does not affect availability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over the network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity, just user interaction |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must be tricked to click |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:N (0.00)
- I:N (0.00)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

**Impact Subscore = 6 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0)) = 0

Since Impact = 0, the Base Score = Exploitability = 2.7 (rounded)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N

#####962#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Zentao versions 4.1.3 and before has a URL redirect vulnerability, which prevents the system from functioning properly."

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** URL redirect vulnerability  
- **Impact:** "prevents the system from functioning properly" — this suggests some availability impact.  
- URL redirect vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to redirect users to malicious sites, which can be used for phishing or other attacks. However, the description emphasizes system malfunction, indicating availability impact.

---

### Step 2: Assign Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  URL redirect vulnerabilities are usually exploitable over the network (e.g., via crafted URLs).  
  **AV = Network (N)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  URL redirect vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit, requiring no special conditions.  
  **AC = Low (L)**

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  Usually, URL redirect vulnerabilities can be exploited without any privileges.  
  **PR = None (N)**

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  URL redirect vulnerabilities often require the user to click a malicious link or visit a crafted URL.  
  So, user interaction is required.  
  **UI = Required (R)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the application itself). No indication that it affects other components or privileges.  
  **S = Unchanged (U)**

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
  **C = None (N)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **I = None (N)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description says "prevents the system from functioning properly," indicating some availability impact.  
  Since it "prevents" functioning, this suggests a **High (H)** impact on availability.

---

### Step 3: Summary of metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Exploitable over network |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | R     | User must interact (click link) |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | H     | High availability impact |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:N (0.00)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 * 1 * 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged:  
  Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
  = round_up(min(3.60 + 2.83, 10))  
  = round_up(6.43) = 6.4

#####963#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Project Worlds Online Admission System 1.0
- Critical severity
- Affects file documents.php
- Leads to unrestricted upload (likely arbitrary file upload)
- Attack may be initiated remotely
- Exploit is public

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack may be initiated remotely" suggests the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description mentions "unrestricted upload," implying no special conditions or complex steps are required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Since the attack can be initiated remotely and leads to unrestricted upload, it likely requires no privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description does not mention the need for user interaction.  
- Typically, file upload vulnerabilities exploited remotely do not require user interaction.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- Unrestricted upload can lead to remote code execution or modification of resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- This usually changes the scope because the impact crosses security boundaries.  
- Therefore, S = Changed (C)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unrestricted upload can lead to arbitrary code execution or data exposure.  
- At minimum, it can lead to some data compromise.  
- Given the critical rating, assume High (H) confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload allows modification or replacement of files, so integrity is highly impacted.  
- Therefore, I = High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Uploading malicious files can disrupt service or cause denial of service.  
- Therefore, A = High (H)

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####964#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Vault and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) may expose sensitive information when enabling an audit device which specifies the `log_raw` option, which may log sensitive information to other audit devices, regardless of whether they are configured to use `log_raw`.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability context

- The vulnerability involves exposure of sensitive information through audit logs.
- The issue arises when an audit device is enabled with the `log_raw` option.
- This causes sensitive information to be logged to other audit devices, even if those devices are not configured to log raw data.
- This suggests an information disclosure vulnerability.
- The attack likely requires the attacker to enable or configure an audit device with `log_raw`.
- Vault is typically accessed over a network.
- The vulnerability is about information exposure, so confidentiality is impacted.
- Integrity and availability are likely unaffected.
- User interaction is probably not required.
- Privileges required: The attacker probably needs some level of access to configure audit devices.
- Scope: The vulnerability affects other audit devices, which may be considered a change in scope.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- Vault is a networked service.  
- The attacker likely exploits this over the network.  
- **AV:N (Network)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must enable an audit device with `log_raw`. This requires some configuration knowledge but no unusual conditions.  
- This is not trivial but not complex either.  
- **AC:L (Low)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must enable or configure an audit device. This implies some level of privileges.  
- Vault has different privilege levels; configuring audit devices is likely a privileged action.  
- Assume **PR:L (Low)** — attacker needs low privileges, not full admin.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker performs the action themselves (configuring audit devices). No other user interaction needed.  
- **UI:N (None)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes sensitive information to be exposed to other audit devices, which may be considered outside the security scope of the vulnerable component.  
- This suggests a **Scope Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Sensitive information is exposed.  
- This is a significant confidentiality impact but not total system compromise.  
- **C:L (Low)** or **C:H (High)**?  
- Since sensitive info is exposed, but not full system data, **C:L (Low)** is appropriate.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that data integrity is affected.  
- **I:N (None)**

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication that availability is affected.  
- **A:N (None)**

---

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:C (Changed)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.68 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.380 ≈ 3.12

**Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):**  
Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 7.52 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 7.52 × 0.22  
= 1.654

**Base Score (Scope Changed):**  
= 1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability)  
= 1.08 × (1.654 + 3.12)  
= 1.08 × 4.774  
= 5.15

Rounded up to one decimal place: **5.2**

#####965#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in Byzoro Smart S150 Management Platform (up to 20240101).
- Affects HTTP POST Request Handler, specifically the argument `web_img`.
- Leads to unrestricted upload (likely arbitrary file upload).
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- Rated as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is launched remotely via HTTP POST request.  
- This means the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- **Value: Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description mentions "unrestricted upload" and no special conditions or environment constraints.  
- The exploit is public and straightforward.  
- **Value: Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The vulnerability allows unrestricted upload via HTTP POST, no mention of needing authentication or privileges.  
- Likely no privileges required.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request; no user interaction is needed.  
- **Value: None (N)**

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the HTTP POST Request Handler component.  
- Unrestricted upload could lead to code execution or other impacts beyond the vulnerable component.  
- However, the description does not explicitly mention privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Usually, unrestricted upload leading to code execution changes scope because it affects the system beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Given the critical rating and unrestricted upload, assume **Scope Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Unrestricted upload itself does not directly disclose information.  
- However, if the attacker can upload arbitrary files, they might read or access sensitive data indirectly.  
- Since the description does not mention data disclosure, but the impact is critical, assume at least **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload can allow an attacker to upload malicious files, potentially modifying or replacing files.  
- This implies at least a **High (H)** integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- Uploading arbitrary files could lead to denial of service (e.g., uploading large files or malicious scripts).  
- Given the critical rating, assume **High (H)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Calculate Impact Sub-Score:**

Impact = 7.52 * [ (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.22)*(1 - 0.56)*(1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.151]  
= 7.52 * 0.849  
= 6.39

**Calculate Exploitability Sub-Score:**

Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.556  
= 8.22 * 0.472  
= 3.88

**Calculate Base Score:**

Since Scope is Changed:

Base Score = RoundUp (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= RoundUp (Minimum [6.39 + 3.88, 10])  
= RoundUp (10.27) → capped at 10.0

**Final Base Score: 10.0 (Critical)**

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Scripting in FireEye EX, version 9.0.3.936727. Exploitation allows an attacker to send a specially crafted JavaScript payload via the 'type' and 's_f_name' parameters to an authenticated user to retrieve their session details.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker sends a payload to an authenticated user, presumably over the network (e.g., via a web interface). Since the attack involves sending a payload remotely, the vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The attacker needs to craft a special JavaScript payload and send it to an authenticated user. There is no indication of environmental or timing conditions that make the attack complex. This is a typical XSS attack, which is generally considered **Low (L)** complexity.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker must be able to send the payload to an authenticated user, but the description does not specify that the attacker needs to be authenticated themselves. Usually, in reflected or stored XSS, the attacker does not need privileges on the target system, just the ability to lure a user to execute the payload. However, the description says "to an authenticated user," which implies the victim must be authenticated, but the attacker may not need to be. So, the attacker does **not** require privileges on the vulnerable system. Therefore, **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attack requires the victim (authenticated user) to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a page). So, **Required (R)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows the attacker to retrieve session details of the authenticated user. This is a typical XSS attack that affects the same security scope (the same application). There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can retrieve session details, which is a confidentiality impact. This is more than a partial leak but less than full system compromise. Usually, session details are sensitive, so this is **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description does not mention the attacker modifying data or changing information. So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No indication of impact on availability. So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | N     | Attack is performed remotely over the network.                                            |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required, typical XSS attack.                                       |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | Attacker does not need privileges on the system.                                          |
| User Interaction (UI)| R      | Victim must interact with the malicious payload.                                          |
| Scope (S)            | U     | Vulnerability affects the same security scope.                                            |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Attacker can retrieve session details (high confidentiality impact).                      |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact described.                                                            |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No availability impact described.                                                         |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 × 1 × 1) = 0.56

Impact = 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.60

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.60 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(6.43) = 6.4

#####967#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"Stack overflow in paddle.linalg.lu_unpack in PaddlePaddle before 2.6.0. This flaw can lead to a denial of service, or even more damage."

---

### Step 1: Determine each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow in a software library function.  
- Typically, such vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely if the function can be triggered over the network or locally if it requires local access.  
- PaddlePaddle is a machine learning framework, often used in environments where code is executed locally or via APIs.  
- Since the description does not specify remote exploitation, but "even more damage" suggests potential for remote exploitation or at least local exploitation.  
- Given the lack of explicit remote exploitation info, but considering typical usage, **Local (L)** is the safest assumption.  
- However, if the function is exposed via network API, it could be Network (N). But no explicit info is given.  
- To be conservative, assume **Local (L)**.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Stack overflow vulnerabilities usually have low complexity if the input can be controlled.  
- No mention of special conditions or complex environment.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
- Does the attacker need privileges?  
- If the function is called by user code, the attacker might need to run code locally.  
- So, likely **Low (L)** privileges required (e.g., user-level access).  
- If the attacker needs no privileges, it would be None (N). But since it's a local function, probably some user-level privileges are needed.  
- So, **Low (L)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
- Does exploitation require user interaction?  
- Usually, stack overflow in a function called by user code does not require additional user interaction.  
- So, **None (N)**.

5. **Scope (S):**  
- Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component?  
- "or even more damage" suggests potential for privilege escalation or affecting other components.  
- Stack overflow can lead to code execution, which can change scope.  
- So, **Changed (C)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
- The description mentions denial of service and "even more damage" but no explicit mention of data disclosure.  
- So, **Low (L)** or **None (N)**?  
- Since "even more damage" could include data disclosure, but not explicitly stated, choose **Low (L)**.

7. **Integrity (I):**  
- Stack overflow can lead to code execution, which affects integrity.  
- So, **High (H)**.

8. **Availability (A):**  
- Denial of service is explicitly mentioned.  
- So, **High (H)**.

### Summary of metric values:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to trigger the flaw |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity to exploit |
| PR     | L     | Low privileges required (user-level) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Scope changed due to potential code execution |
| C      | L     | Possible low confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | High integrity impact (code execution) |
| A      | H     | High availability impact (denial of service) |

---

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.87

**Impact Subscore (Changed Scope):**  
Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.151)  
= 7.52 * 0.849 ≈ 6.39

**Base Score (Changed Scope):**  
= 1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability)  
= 1.08 * (6.39 + 1.87)  
= 1.08 * 8.26 ≈ 8.92

Rounded to one decimal place: **8.9**

#####968#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability in savignano S/Notify before 4.0.2 for Jira.
- The issue is a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack.
- Requires an administrative user to be logged in.
- The attacker tricks the admin into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
- The attacker can modify configuration settings of the S/Notify app.
- Impact: configuration changes can disable encryption of email notifications.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed by the admin clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
- The attacker does not need local or physical access.
- The attack is performed over the network (web).
- **AV = Network (N)**

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attack requires the admin to be logged in and to click a malicious link or visit a malicious website.
- This is a typical CSRF scenario, which is generally considered low complexity because it only requires user interaction, no special conditions.
- **AC = Low (L)**

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker does not have privileges themselves.
- The attacker relies on the admin's privileges.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- **PR = None (N)**

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attack requires the admin to click a malicious link or visit a malicious website.
- This is user interaction.
- **UI = Required (R)**

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows modification of the configuration of the S/Notify app.
- The impact is limited to the same security scope (the Jira application).
- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component.
- **S = Unchanged (U)**

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker can modify configuration settings.
- The description mentions that email notifications may no longer be encrypted.
- This implies a confidentiality impact because sensitive information could be exposed.
- However, the attacker does not directly read confidential data, but weakens confidentiality protections.
- According to CVSS guidelines, weakening encryption or disabling confidentiality controls is considered a **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.
- **C = Low (L)**

**Integrity (I):**

- The attacker can modify configuration settings.
- This is a direct modification of data/configuration.
- This is a **High (H)** integrity impact.
- **I = High (H)**

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of availability impact.
- The attacker does not cause denial of service or disruption.
- **A = None (N)**

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Attack over network (web) |
| AC     | L     | Low complexity (typical CSRF) |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required by attacker |
| UI     | R     | Requires user (admin) interaction |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged (within Jira app) |
| C      | L     | Confidentiality weakened (encryption disabled) |
| I      | H     | Integrity fully compromised (config modified) |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.85 = 4.573  
4.573 × 0.62 = 2.836 (approx)

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.44 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.3432  
= 0.6568

Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged) = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.6568  
= 4.217 (approx)

**Base Score:**

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(4.217 + 2.836, 10))  
= round_up(7.053)  
= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in CodeAstro Vehicle Booking System 1.0
- Affected component: User Registration (usr/usr-register.php)
- Attack vector: Remote (possible to initiate the attack remotely)
- Attack complexity: Not explicitly stated, but typical XSS attacks are straightforward once the input is reflected/stored without sanitization → Low complexity
- Privileges required: None mentioned; attacker can supply input remotely → None
- User interaction: XSS usually requires the victim to visit a crafted page or click a link → User interaction required
- Scope: No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component → Unchanged
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:
  - Confidentiality: XSS can lead to cookie theft or session hijacking → Low impact on confidentiality
  - Integrity: XSS can allow script execution but does not directly modify data → Low impact on integrity
  - Availability: Usually no direct impact → None

---

### Assigning CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
  Reason: The attack can be initiated remotely over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: No special conditions or timing required; straightforward XSS.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  
  Reason: No privileges needed to exploit.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)  
  Reason: The victim must interact (e.g., visit a malicious page or click a link).

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  Reason: The vulnerability affects only the vulnerable component.

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Reason: XSS can leak sensitive information like cookies.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Script execution can alter user interactions but not backend data.

- **Availability (A):** None (N)  
  Reason: No impact on availability.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####970#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description:**  
NVIDIA DGX A100 SBIOS contains a vulnerability where a local attacker can cause input validation checks to be bypassed by causing an integer overflow. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker is described as "local," meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.  
  **AV:L (Local)**

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability involves causing an integer overflow to bypass input validation. This suggests the attack is not trivial but also not highly complex. Usually, integer overflow exploits are considered low complexity if no special conditions are required. Since no special conditions or timing are mentioned, assume **AC:L (Low)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is described as "local attacker," but it does not specify if any privileges are required. Since it says "local attacker" and not "privileged user," assume the attacker needs to be logged in but no elevated privileges are required.  
  In CVSS v3.1, "local attacker" usually implies at least some user privileges (Low) unless explicitly stated as no privileges. Since it is SBIOS (firmware), local access might mean user-level access. So, **PR:L (Low)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of user interaction required for the exploit. The attacker is local and can cause the overflow directly.  
  **UI:N (None)**

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects SBIOS, which is firmware, and the impact includes information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service. If the vulnerability allows impact beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., affecting the OS or other components), scope is changed.  
  Since SBIOS is a separate component and the impact includes data tampering and information disclosure, likely the scope is **Changed (C)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description mentions "information disclosure." This implies at least Low confidentiality impact.  
  **C:L (Low)**

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The description mentions "data tampering," which implies integrity impact.  
  **I:L (Low)**

- **Availability (A):**  
  The description mentions "denial of service," which implies availability impact.  
  **A:L (Low)**

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Changed) = 0.68  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.68 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.246  
≈ 2.02

**Impact Subscore:**  
Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.474  
= 0.526

Since Scope is Changed (C),  
Impact Subscore = 7.52 * (Impact - 0.029) - 3.25 * (Impact - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * (0.526 - 0.029) - 3.25 * (0.526 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 * 0.497 - 3.25 * (0.506)^15  
= 3.74 - 3.25 * very small number  
≈ 3.74 (since (0.506)^15 is very small)

**Base Score:**  
If Impact <= 0, Base Score = 0  
Else, if Scope is Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (3.74 + 2.02), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 5.76, 10))  
= round_up(6.22)  
= 6.2 → 6.2 rounds to 6.2 (CVSS scores are rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Authentication bypass in vector-admin allows a user to register to a vector-admin server while “domain restriction” is active, even when not owning an authorized email address.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability allows a user to register to the server remotely. Since this involves interacting with a server over the network, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description suggests the bypass happens simply by registering, no special conditions or complex steps are mentioned. So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is a user who is not authorized (does not own an authorized email address), so no privileges are required to exploit this. **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The attacker is the user registering themselves; no other user needs to interact. So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the vector-admin server). No indication that the impact crosses security boundaries. So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The description does not mention data disclosure. The attacker can register, but no direct info leak is described. So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can bypass authentication and register, which means they can create an account they shouldn't have. This impacts integrity of the authentication system. This is a **Low (L)** impact because the attacker can add unauthorized accounts but not necessarily modify existing data.

- **Availability (A):**  
  No mention of availability impact. So, **None (N)**.

### Step 2: Summary of Metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Remote network attack |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction needed |
| S      | U     | Same security scope |
| C      | N     | No confidentiality impact |
| I      | L     | Integrity impact due to unauthorized registration |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.88

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 0.78 * 1)  
= 6.42 * (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 3.88, 10))  
= round_up(5.29)  
= 5.3 (Medium severity)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

#####972#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty versions 17.0.0.3 through 24.0.0.4 are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) caused by sending a specially crafted request. A remote attacker can exploit this to cause the server to consume memory resources.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The attacker sends a specially crafted request remotely. This implies the attack can be performed over the network.  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity; it just requires sending a crafted request. This suggests low complexity.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and sends a crafted request, no mention of needing any privileges.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No mention of requiring user interaction; the attacker sends the request directly.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability causes the server to consume memory resources, which is a resource exhaustion DoS. The impact is on the same component (the server itself), no indication that the vulnerability affects other components or security authorities.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No mention of data modification or integrity impact.  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **Availability (A):**  
  The vulnerability causes a denial of service by consuming memory resources, which impacts availability. The impact is likely significant but not necessarily complete shutdown. Usually, DoS vulnerabilities are rated as Low or High availability impact depending on severity. Since it causes resource consumption leading to DoS, it is reasonable to assign **High (H)** availability impact.  
  **Value:** High (H)

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####973#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Directory Traversal via rename_item function.
- Impact: Allows authenticated attackers to rename arbitrary files on the server.
- Potential consequence: Site takeover if critical files (e.g., wp-config.php) are renamed.
- Exploitation conditions:
  - Requires authentication.
  - By default, only administrators can exploit.
  - In premium version, lower privilege users (as low as contributors) may exploit if granted gallery management permissions.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The attack is performed over the web (WordPress plugin).
- The attacker must be authenticated and interact with the plugin.
- The vulnerability is exploited remotely over the network.
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.
- The attack seems straightforward once authenticated.
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- By default, only administrators can exploit (high privileges).
- In premium version, contributors (lower privileges) can exploit if granted permissions.
- Contributors have "Low" privileges in WordPress.
- Since the vulnerability can be exploited by low privileges in some cases, and by high privileges in others, we take the least privilege required for the base score.
- CVSS guidance: When multiple privilege levels apply, choose the lowest privilege level required.
- Therefore, PR = Low (L).

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The attacker is authenticated and performs the action.
- No mention of needing another user to interact.
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows renaming arbitrary files on the server.
- This can lead to site takeover, which affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.
- The vulnerable component is the plugin; the impact affects the entire WordPress site.
- This indicates a change in scope.
- Therefore, S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**

- Renaming files can lead to site takeover.
- Site takeover implies full control, including confidentiality impact.
- Therefore, C = High (H).

**Integrity (I):**

- Renaming files affects integrity of the system.
- The attacker can modify file names, potentially disabling or replacing files.
- Therefore, I = High (H).

**Availability (A):**

- Renaming critical files can cause denial of service or site unavailability.
- Therefore, A = High (H).

| Scope (S)            | C      | Impact affects resources beyond the vulnerable component                                  |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H      | Full site takeover possible, high confidentiality impact                                  |
| Integrity (I)        | H      | Arbitrary file renaming affects integrity                                                |
| Availability (A)     | H      | Can cause site unavailability                                                           |

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####974#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Navicat 12.0.29, affecting MySQL Connection Handler.
- Leads to denial of service (DoS).
- Attack requires local access ("Attacking locally is a requirement").
- Exploit is publicly disclosed.
- No mention of user interaction.
- No mention of privilege escalation or required privileges.
- No mention of scope change.
- Impact is denial of service (availability impact).
- Confidentiality and integrity impacts are not mentioned, so presumably none.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "Attacking locally is a requirement" → Local (L)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- No mention of complex conditions or environment; exploit is public → Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- No explicit mention of required privileges, but since attack is local, likely requires some privileges on the system.  
- Usually, local attacks require at least Low privileges unless specified otherwise.  
- Since it is local and no mention of privilege escalation, assume Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of user interaction required → None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- No mention of impact beyond the vulnerable component → Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- No mention of confidentiality impact → None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- No mention of integrity impact → None (N)

**Availability (A):**  
- "The manipulation leads to denial of service" → High (H)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV:L (Local)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:N (None)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:N = 0.00  
- I:N = 0.00  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.62 * 0.85 ≈ 1.82

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.44)  
= 6.42 * 0.56 ≈ 3.59

**Base Score =**  
- Since Scope is Unchanged,  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.59 + 1.82, 10))  
= round_up(5.41) = 5.4 → 5.4 rounds to 5.4 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal place)

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

#####975#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: WordPress plugin "Essential Addons for Elementor"
- Affected versions: up to 5.9.4
- Attack vector: Injection via the Login/Register element on a custom login URL
- Attacker privileges: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
- Impact: Arbitrary script execution when a injected page is accessed by any user

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed over the web (plugin login/register page).  
- The attacker must be authenticated and inject scripts that execute when other users visit the page.  
- The injection is done remotely via the web interface.  
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.  
- The attacker must have contributor-level permissions and inject scripts via the login/register element.  
- No special conditions or timing required beyond having contributor access.  
- This is a straightforward injection once privileges are obtained.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or above permissions.  
- Contributor is a low-level privilege in WordPress, but it is not "None".  
- According to CVSS v3.1, "Low" privileges means privileges that provide basic user capabilities but not administrative.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker injects scripts that execute when other users access the injected page.  
- The victim user must visit the page for the script to execute.  
- This requires user interaction (the victim must access the page).  
- Therefore, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the WordPress plugin and its users).  
- The impact is on the same component (plugin and WordPress user session).  
- No privilege escalation or impact beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.  
- This can lead to partial or full disclosure of user data.  
- The impact is likely **Low (L)** because it affects user data but not the entire system or database directly.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying displayed content or performing actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a modification of data or behavior.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- No indication that the attack causes denial of service or resource exhaustion.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial disclosure of user data possible via script execution.                            |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Modification of data or behavior via script injection.                                   |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability.                                                                |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:R (0.62)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:L (0.22)
- A:N (0.00)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.62 = 2.068

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084  
= 0.3916

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.3916  
= 2.515

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup (minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (2.515 + 2.068)  
= Roundup (4.583)  
= 4.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Security agent link following vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One  
- Impact: Local attacker can escalate privileges  
- Preconditions: Attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system  
- Attack vector: Local (since attacker must have local code execution)  
- Privileges required: Low (attacker must have low-privileged code execution)  
- User interaction: Not mentioned, so assume none required  
- Scope: Privilege escalation on the same system, so scope is unchanged  
- Impact: Privilege escalation implies impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, but likely limited to local system privileges. Usually, privilege escalation affects Integrity and possibly Confidentiality and Availability to some degree. Since the description is about privilege escalation, we can assume at least Low impact on C, I, and A.

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must execute code locally.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: No special conditions or environment complexity mentioned.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must have low-privileged code execution.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  Reason: No user interaction mentioned or implied.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  Reason: The vulnerability affects the same security scope (local system).

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation can lead to some confidentiality impact.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation impacts integrity.

- **Availability (A):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation could impact availability, but no indication of high impact.

---

### Summary of Metrics:

- AV:L  
- AC:L  
- PR:L  
- UI:N  
- S:U  
- C:L  
- I:L  
- A:L

### Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:L = 0.22  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22))  
= 6 × (1 - 0.78 × 0.78 × 0.78)  
= 6 × (1 - 0.474)  
= 6 × 0.526 = 3.16

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = Roundup(Min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= Roundup(Min(3.16 + 1.83, 10))  
= Roundup(4.99) = 5.0

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in livewire before v3.0.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code getCsrfToken function. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the 5d88731 commit fixes a usability problem (HTTP 419 status codes for legitimate client activity), not a security problem.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type:** CSRF vulnerability
- **Effect:** Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the getCsrfToken function.
- **Attack Vector:** Remote attackers can exploit this, so likely Network.
- **Privileges Required:** Since it's CSRF, usually no privileges are required.
- **User Interaction:** CSRF requires the victim to perform some action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious site).
- **Scope:** Does the vulnerability affect resources beyond the vulnerable component? Arbitrary code execution suggests it might affect the same scope.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution implies high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

---

### Step 2: Assign values to each metric

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  CSRF attacks are typically performed over the network (via the victim's browser). So AV:N (Network).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks require the attacker to trick the user into performing an action, but no special conditions beyond that. Usually AC:L (Low).

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system; the victim's privileges are used. So PR:N (None).

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  CSRF requires the victim to interact (e.g., visit a malicious page). So UI:R (Required).

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution within the same component (livewire). No indication that the scope changes beyond the vulnerable component. So S:U (Unchanged).

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can lead to full data disclosure. So C:H (High).

- **Integrity (I):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can modify data. So I:H (High).

- **Availability (A):**  
  Arbitrary code execution can disrupt service. So A:H (High).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with:

- AV:N
- AC:L
- PR:N
- UI:R
- S:U
- C:H
- I:H
- A:H

### Step 4: Summary of metrics

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Remote network attack via victim's browser     |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions required                  |
| Privileges Required (PR)| N   | No privileges required by attacker              |
| User Interaction (UI)| R     | Victim must interact (CSRF requires user action)|
| Scope (S)            | U     | Impact limited to vulnerable component          |
| Confidentiality (C)  | H     | Arbitrary code execution leads to full disclosure|
| Integrity (I)        | H     | Arbitrary code execution leads to full modification|
| Availability (A)     | H     | Arbitrary code execution can disrupt availability|

### Step 5: CVSS v3.1 Vector String

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

---

### Step 6: Base Score (for reference)

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator:

- Exploitability sub-score:  
  - AV:N = 0.85  
  - AC:L = 0.77  
  - PR:N = 0.85  
  - UI:R = 0.62  
  Exploitability = 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.62 ≈ 2.68

- Impact sub-score:  
  - C:H = 0.56  
  - I:H = 0.56  
  - A:H = 0.56  
  Impact = 1 - [(1-0.56)*(1-0.56)*(1-0.56)] = 1 - (0.44*0.44*0.44) = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915

- Impact score = 6.42 * Impact = 6.42 * 0.915 = 5.88

- Base score = round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10)) = round_up(5.88 + 2.68) = round_up(8.56) = 8.6

Rounded to one decimal place: **8.6 (High)**

**Final output:**

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#####978#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
Deserialization of Untrusted Data in jeecgFormDemoController in JEECG 4.0 and earlier allows attackers to run arbitrary code via crafted POST request.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed via a crafted POST request, which implies the attacker can send data over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- Deserialization vulnerabilities typically require the attacker to craft a specific payload, but this is generally considered low complexity because no special conditions or environment are needed beyond sending the crafted request.  
- AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges before sending the malicious request.  
- The attacker can send the crafted POST request without authentication.  
- PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request directly; no user interaction is required.  
- UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which likely affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself.  
- Deserialization leading to code execution usually means the attacker can affect the system beyond the vulnerable component's privileges, so Scope is Changed (C).  
- S = Changed (C).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can lead to full system compromise, including data disclosure.  
- So, Confidentiality impact is High (H).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Arbitrary code execution allows the attacker to modify data or system state.  
- Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary code execution can disrupt system availability (e.g., by deleting files, crashing services).  
- Availability impact is High (H).

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: C (Changed)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: H (High)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:H = 0.56

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.91

**Impact = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.085)  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

Since Scope is Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (6.88 + 3.91), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 10.79, 10))  
= round_up(min(11.65, 10))  
= 10.0

#####979#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability type: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Affects: a-blog cms versions prior to certain fixed versions
- Attack vector: Remote attacker
- Attacker: Authenticated (remote authenticated attacker)
- Impact: Execute arbitrary script on the logged-in user's web browser

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker is remote and can exploit the vulnerability over the network (web application).  
- AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity if the attacker can inject scripts easily.  
- No special conditions or environment needed beyond authentication.  
- AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be authenticated (remote authenticated attacker).  
- This implies some privileges are required, but not high privileges necessarily.  
- PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker executes a script on the logged-in user's browser, so the victim user must interact (e.g., visit a malicious link or page).  
- UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application and its users).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- S = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- XSS can lead to disclosure of information accessible to the victim user (e.g., cookies, session tokens).  
- This is typically considered a Low impact on confidentiality.  
- C = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- XSS can allow script execution that may modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user.  
- This is typically Low impact on integrity.  
- I = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- XSS generally does not impact availability.  
- A = None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

- AV:N (Network)  
- AC:L (Low)  
- PR:L (Low)  
- UI:R (Required)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:L (Low)  
- I:L (Low)  
- A:N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:L (Scope Unchanged) = 0.62  
- UI:R = 0.62  
- S:U  
- C:L = 0.22  
- I:L = 0.22  
- A:N = 0.00

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.62 ≈ 2.05

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.78 × 0.78 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.6084 = 0.3916

**Impact:**  
= 6.42 × Impact Subscore  
= 6.42 × 0.3916 ≈ 2.51

**Base Score:**  
= If Impact <= 0, then 0, else round up to 1 decimal place:  
= round_up(min((Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(2.51 + 2.05) = round_up(4.56) = 4.6

#####980#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in the function exec of payment.php
- Attack vector: The attack may be initiated remotely
- Severity: Critical
- Exploit: Publicly disclosed and may be used
- Impact: SQL Injection typically affects confidentiality, integrity, and possibly availability depending on the context

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "The attack may be initiated remotely" implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities are generally straightforward to exploit if the input is not sanitized.  
- No mention of special conditions or complexity.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs any privileges.  
- SQL Injection usually requires no privileges if the input is from an unauthenticated user.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker manipulates the argument `id` directly, no mention of needing another user to interact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (payment.php) and no indication that the impact crosses security boundaries.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized data disclosure.  
- Since it is rated critical, assume high impact on confidentiality.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL Injection can allow modification of data.  
- Assume high impact on integrity.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL Injection can sometimes lead to denial of service, but no explicit mention here.  
- To be conservative, assume no impact on availability.  
- **Value:** None (N)

---

### Step 2: Summarize metric values

- AV: N (Network)  
- AC: L (Low)  
- PR: N (None)  
- UI: N (None)  
- S: U (Unchanged)  
- C: H (High)  
- I: H (High)  
- A: N (None)

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:H = 0.56  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 1)  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 3.89, 10))  
= round_up(9.07) = 9.1 → 9.1 rounds to 9.1 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

#####981#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Active debug code exists in Yamaha wireless LAN access point devices.
- Exploitation requires a **logged-in user** who knows how to use the debug function.
- The user accesses the device's management page and performs specific operations to enable the debug function.
- Consequences: arbitrary OS command execution and/or alteration of device configuration settings.
- Affected devices: various Yamaha wireless LAN access points.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attacker must be a logged-in user accessing the device's management page.  
- This implies local network access, but not necessarily physical access.  
- Since the device is a network device and the management page is accessed over the network, but the attacker must be authenticated, the vector is likely **Adjacent (A)** or **Network (N)**.  
- However, since the attacker must be logged in (authenticated), and the device is a network device, the attack is performed over the network but requires authentication.  
- CVSS guidance: If the attacker must be on the same network segment or adjacent network, use Adjacent (A). If the attack can be performed from anywhere on the internet, use Network (N).  
- Since it is a wireless LAN access point, and the attacker must be logged in, it is likely Adjacent (A) because the attacker must be on the local network or connected to the device.  
**AV = A**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attacker must perform "specific operations" to enable the debug function.  
- The debug function is active but not publicly exposed; the attacker must know how to use it.  
- This suggests some specialized knowledge or steps are required, but no mention of timing or environmental conditions.  
- This is more than trivial but not very complex.  
- CVSS guidance: If the attack requires special conditions or knowledge, AC is High; if not, Low.  
- Here, "specific operations" and knowledge of the debug function suggest **High (H)**.  
**AC = H**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must be a "logged-in user."  
- So, some level of authentication is required.  
- The description does not specify if the user must be an administrator or just a normal user.  
- Since the debug function can be enabled by a logged-in user who "knows how to use the debug function," it suggests that any authenticated user can exploit it.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** privileges required (not None, because login is required, but not High because admin is not specified).  
**PR = L**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker is the logged-in user performing the attack.  
- No mention of needing another user to interact.  
- The attacker themselves performs the action.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.  
**UI = N**

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary OS command execution and/or configuration changes on the device itself.  
- The impact is on the same device (the access point).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.  
**S = U**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data disclosure, but arbitrary command execution can lead to high confidentiality impact.  
- Given the severity, assume **High (H)** confidentiality impact.  
**C = H**

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can alter configuration settings and execute arbitrary OS commands.  
- This clearly impacts integrity.  
- Assume **High (H)**.  
**I = H**

---

**Availability (A):**  
- Arbitrary OS command execution can disrupt device operation.  
- Altering configuration can also cause denial of service.  
- Assume **High (H)** availability impact.  
**A = H**

---

### Summary of metrics:

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | A     | Adjacent network access (logged-in user on local network) |
| AC     | H     | Specific operations and knowledge required |
| PR     | L     | Logged-in user required (low privileges) |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required beyond attacker |
| S      | U     | Impact limited to the vulnerable device |
| C      | H     | Arbitrary command execution leads to high confidentiality impact |
| I      | H     | Configuration and command execution impact integrity |
| A      | H     | Potential to disrupt device availability |

### Step 2: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:A (0.62)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) [for Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.62 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.144  
≈ 1.18

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 6.42 × [1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - (0.44 × 0.44 × 0.44)]  
= 6.42 × [1 - 0.085]  
= 6.42 × 0.915  
≈ 5.87

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(5.87 + 1.18, 10))  
= round_up(7.05)  
= 7.1 → 7.1 rounds to 7.1 (CVSS scores are rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Heap-based buffer overflow in `__vsyslog_internal` function of glibc.
- Trigger: When `openlog` is not called or called with `ident` set to NULL, and the program name (basename of argv[0]) is larger than 1024 bytes.
- Impact: Application crash or local privilege escalation.
- Affected versions: glibc 2.36 and newer.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is triggered by passing a specially crafted program name (argv[0]) larger than 1024 bytes.
- This requires the attacker to execute a program locally with a crafted argv[0].
- The attack cannot be performed remotely or over the network.
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must provide a program name larger than 1024 bytes.
- This is a specific condition but not particularly complex for a local attacker.
- No additional conditions like race conditions or timing attacks are mentioned.
- Therefore, the attack complexity is **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The description mentions local privilege escalation.
- The attacker must already be able to execute a program locally.
- It is not stated that the attacker needs elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
- Usually, local privilege escalation vulnerabilities require **Low (L)** privileges (normal user).
- So, PR is **Low (L)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**

- The vulnerability is triggered by executing a program with a crafted argv[0].
- No user interaction is required beyond the attacker running the program.
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability leads to local privilege escalation.
- This means the impact crosses from one security scope (user) to another (higher privilege).
- Therefore, **Changed (C)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The description does not mention data disclosure.
- The impact is crash or privilege escalation.
- So, confidentiality impact is **None (N)**.

**Integrity (I):**

- Local privilege escalation implies the attacker can modify system or sensitive data.
- So, integrity impact is **High (H)**.

**Availability (A):**

- The vulnerability can cause application crash.
- Crash is a denial of service, which is a low impact on availability.
- So, availability impact is **Low (L)**.

| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | No special conditions beyond crafted input.                                               |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Attacker needs local user privileges to run program.                                      |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required.                                                             |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:L (0.22)

**Explaining PR:L with Scope Changed:**

- For Scope Changed, PR:L = 0.62 (instead of 0.68 for Scope Unchanged).

---

**Base Score Calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.223 ≈ 1.83

2. Impact Subscore:

- ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.22)]  
= 1 - [1 × 0.44 × 0.78]  
= 1 - 0.3432 = 0.6568

3. Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × (0.6568 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.6568 - 0.02)^15  
= 7.52 × 0.6278 - 3.25 × (0.6368)^15  
= 4.72 - 3.25 × very small number (≈0)  
≈ 4.72

4. Since Scope is Changed:  
Base Score = round_up(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × (4.72 + 1.83), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 × 6.55, 10))  
= round_up(7.07)  
= 7.1 (rounded to one decimal place)

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Base Score Calculation:**

1. Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

2. Impact Sub-Score (Scope Changed):  
Impact = 7.52 * [ (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) ]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (1 - 0.56)*(1 - 0.56)*(1 - 0.56)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - (0.44 * 0.44 * 0.44)]  
= 7.52 * [1 - 0.085]  
= 7.52 * 0.915 ≈ 6.88

3. Base Score (Scope Changed):  
If Impact > 0:  
BaseScore = RoundUp (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= RoundUp (6.88 + 3.89) = RoundUp (10.77) = 10.0 (max score)

---

### Assigning CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   The attack is performed remotely over the network via a web parameter.  
   **Value:** Network (N)

- PR:N (None)  
- UI:N (None)  
- S:U (Unchanged)  
- C:H (High)  
- I:N (None)  
- A:N (None)

### Calculating the CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N = 0.85  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Unchanged) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:U  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.7225  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.5565

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

#####986#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
In the Linux kernel, a fix was made to the gpio mockup driver to prevent a potential resource leakage when registering a chip. Specifically, if creation of a software node fails, a locally allocated string array was not freed, causing a resource leak.

---

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

- **Type of vulnerability:** Resource leak (memory/resource not freed on error path).
- **Impact:** Potential resource leakage, which could lead to resource exhaustion or degraded system performance.
- **Attack vector:** The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel gpio mockup driver, which is a software component.
- **Exploitability:** The description does not mention any privilege escalation or code execution.
- **User interaction:** Not mentioned, likely none.
- **Scope:** The issue is within the kernel component itself.
- **Impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability:** Resource leak typically affects availability (denial of service or degraded performance). No indication of confidentiality or integrity impact.

---

### Step 2: Assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel driver. To exploit it, an attacker would likely need to interact with the kernel subsystem.  
  Since the kernel is local to the system, and the vulnerability is in a driver, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  The vulnerability is a resource leak triggered by failure in software node creation. This is a straightforward bug, no special conditions or timing required.  
  So, **Low (L)**.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  To trigger the bug, the attacker likely needs to interact with the kernel driver, which usually requires some privileges.  
  Since this is a kernel driver, normal users may not have direct access to register chips or create software nodes.  
  So, **High (H)** privileges required.

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  No user interaction is required to trigger the bug once privileges are obtained.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability affects the kernel driver itself, no indication that it affects other components or changes privileges outside the kernel.  
  So, **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  No confidentiality impact mentioned.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Integrity (I):**  
  No integrity impact mentioned.  
  So, **None (N)**.

- **Availability (A):**  
  Resource leak can degrade availability by exhausting resources.  
  The impact is likely **Low (L)** because it is a potential leak, not a full denial of service.  
  So, **Low (L)**.

### Step 3: Summary of metric values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)    | L     | Local access to kernel driver required                                    |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| L     | Simple bug, no special conditions                                        |
| Privileges Required (PR)| H   | High privileges needed to interact with kernel driver                    |
| User Interaction (UI)| N      | No user interaction required                                             |
| Scope (S)            | U      | Impact confined to the kernel driver                                     |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N      | No confidentiality impact                                                |
| Integrity (I)        | N      | No integrity impact                                                      |
| Availability (A)     | L      | Resource leak causes low impact on availability                          |

---

### Step 4: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the standard CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:H (0.27) [Scope Unchanged]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:L (0.22)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.27 * 0.85 ≈ 0.79

**Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.22))  
= 6.42 * (1 - 1 * 1 * 0.78)  
= 6.42 * 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 0.79, 10))  
= round_up(2.20) = 2.2 → 2.2 rounds to 2.2 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

#####987#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds read due to insufficient input validation.  
- Impact: Disclosure of process memory (confidentiality impact).  
- Affected systems: macOS Ventura 13.3, tvOS 16.4, iOS 16.4, iPadOS 16.4, watchOS 9.4.  
- Trigger: Processing an image.  

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing an image.  
- Typically, image processing vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if the image is received over a network (e.g., opening a malicious image file or viewing it in an app).  
- Since the description does not specify local access or physical access, and given the nature of image processing (e.g., opening an image in an app or receiving it via network), the most reasonable assumption is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to input validation issues.  
- Usually, such vulnerabilities have low complexity if no special conditions are required.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or timing requirements.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker likely does not need any privileges to trigger the vulnerability, as it involves processing an image.  
- Usually, opening or processing an image does not require privileges beyond what a normal user has.  
- Since the impact is disclosure of process memory, and the attacker can supply the image, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The description says "processing an image may result in disclosure."  
- The user likely needs to open or view the image for the vulnerability to be triggered.  
- This implies user interaction is required.  
- Therefore, **Required (R)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability causes disclosure of process memory.  
- The description does not indicate that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component or process.  
- No indication that the scope changes (e.g., from one component to another).  
- Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability results in disclosure of process memory.  
- This is a confidentiality impact.  
- The impact is likely more than low because process memory disclosure can reveal sensitive information.  
- However, since it is an out-of-bounds read and not full system compromise, **Low (L)** is appropriate.

**Integrity (I):**  
- No indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

**Availability (A):**  
- No indication of impact on availability.  
- Therefore, **None (N)**.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula with the above values:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:R (0.62)  
- S:U  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:N (0.00)  
- A:N (0.00)  

**Exploitability Subscore:**  
= 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.62 ≈ 2.83

**Impact Subscore:**  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))  
= 6.42 × (1 - (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0))  
= 6.42 × (1 - 0.78)  
= 6.42 × 0.22 ≈ 1.41

**Base Score:**  
Since Scope is Unchanged:  
Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(1.41 + 2.83, 10))  
= round_up(4.24)  
= 4.2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A GPU kernel can read sensitive data from another GPU kernel (even from another user or app) through an optimized GPU memory region called _local memory_ on various architectures.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability involves a GPU kernel reading data from another GPU kernel.  
- This implies the attacker must have some level of access to run code on the GPU.  
- Since GPU kernels typically run locally on the machine, this is not exploitable remotely over a network.  
- The attacker likely needs to be local or adjacent (e.g., same machine or same physical device).  
- Adjacent (A) is typically for local network or shared physical medium; here, the attacker must run code on the same machine, so **Local (L)** is more appropriate.  
**AV = L**

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The attack requires running a GPU kernel that reads from another kernel's memory.  
- This suggests some knowledge and ability to craft GPU kernels, but no indication of complex conditions or timing.  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or race conditions.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)** complexity.  
**AC = L**

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must run a GPU kernel.  
- Running a GPU kernel usually requires user-level privileges, but not necessarily elevated privileges.  
- The description says "even from another user or app," implying no elevated privileges are needed.  
- So, **None (N)** privileges required.  
**PR = N**

---

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker runs a GPU kernel to exploit the vulnerability.  
- No mention of needing another user to do anything.  
- So, **None (N)** user interaction.  
**UI = N**

---

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows reading data from another GPU kernel, potentially from another user or app.  
- This means the impact crosses security boundaries (from one user/app to another).  
- Therefore, the scope is **Changed (C)**.  
**S = C**

---

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows reading sensitive data from another kernel.  
- This is a clear confidentiality impact.  
- The description suggests full read access to sensitive data, so **High (H)** confidentiality impact.  
**C = H**

---

**Integrity (I):**  
- The vulnerability is about reading data, not modifying it.  
- No indication of integrity impact.  
- **None (N)** integrity impact.  
**I = N**

---

**Availability (A):**  
- No mention of disruption or denial of service.  
- **None (N)** availability impact.  
**A = N**

---

### Step 2: Summary of metric values

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | L     | Local access required to run GPU kernel |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions, low complexity |
| PR     | N     | No privileges required to run GPU kernel |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | C     | Impact crosses security boundaries (different user/app) |
| C      | H     | Sensitive data read (high confidentiality impact) |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

---

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L = 0.55  
- AC:L = 0.77  
- PR:N (Scope Changed) = 0.85  
- UI:N = 0.85  
- S:C  
- C:H = 0.56  
- I:N = 0.0  
- A:N = 0.0  

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.55 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 2.52

**Impact (Scope Changed) = 7.52 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))**  
= 7.52 * (1 - (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0))  
= 7.52 * (1 - 0.44) = 7.52 * 0.56 = 4.21

**Base Score =**  
If Impact <= 0, score = 0  
Else, since Scope is Changed:  
BaseScore = round_up(min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * (4.21 + 2.52), 10))  
= round_up(min(1.08 * 6.73, 10))  
= round_up(7.27) = 7.3

C: H (High)

#####989#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description:**  
A SQL injection vulnerability exists in Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 and prior versions. An attacker can pass in crafted offset, limit, and sort parameters to perform SQL injection via /system/dataPerm/list.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability is exploitable by passing crafted parameters to a web endpoint (/system/dataPerm/list).  
- This implies the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- SQL injection vulnerabilities typically require low complexity if the attacker can directly inject parameters.  
- No special conditions or timing required are mentioned.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- The attacker can send crafted parameters directly.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker sends crafted parameters directly to the endpoint; no user interaction is required.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same component (the web application) and does not indicate that it affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  
- No indication that the scope is changed.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- SQL injection can lead to unauthorized data disclosure.  
- The description implies the attacker can perform SQL injection, which often leads to data leakage.  
- Since the description does not specify full database disclosure, but SQL injection usually allows at least some data access, assign **High (H)** to reflect significant confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- SQL injection can allow modification of data.  
- The description does not explicitly mention data modification, but SQL injection often allows it.  
- Assign **High (H)** to reflect potential data integrity impact.

**Availability (A):**  
- SQL injection can sometimes be used to cause denial of service, but the description does not mention availability impact.  
- Assign **None (N)** as no availability impact is described.

|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | N     | Exploitable over the network via HTTP request                             |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:U  
- C:H (0.56)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.37

**Impact Subscore = 1 - [(1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]**  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 * 0.44 * 1]  
= 1 - 0.1936 = 0.8064

**Impact = 6.42 * Impact Subscore**  
= 6.42 * 0.8064 ≈ 5.18

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**  
= round_up(min(5.18 + 4.37, 10))  
= round_up(9.55) = 9.6 → 9.6 rounds to 9.6 (CVSS scores are typically reported with one decimal)

**Severity:** High (7.0 - 8.9 is High, 9.0 - 10.0 is Critical)  
9.6 is in the Critical range.

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine each CVSS v3.1 base metric:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in Tenda W9 1.0.0.7(4456), function formAddSysLogRule in httpd component.
- Stack-based buffer overflow via manipulation of argument sysRulenEn.
- Attack can be launched remotely.
- Exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used.
- Critical severity.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack can be launched remotely.  
- The vulnerable component is httpd (web server), so the attacker can exploit it over the network.  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N).

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by manipulating an argument.  
- No mention of special conditions or environment needed.  
- The exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used, implying low complexity.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L).

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attack is launched remotely against httpd.  
- No mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- Therefore, PR = None (N).

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention that user interaction is required.  
- The attacker can send a crafted request to httpd.  
- Therefore, UI = None (N).

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability is in the httpd component, which is part of the same security authority (likely the same process or system).  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U).

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stack-based buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or crash.  
- No explicit mention of data disclosure, but buffer overflow can lead to information disclosure.  
- Given the critical rating and typical impact of buffer overflows, assume at least Low impact on confidentiality.  
- Therefore, C = Low (L).

**Integrity (I):**  
- Buffer overflow can allow attacker to execute arbitrary code, modify data, or system state.  
- Therefore, Integrity impact is High (H).

**Availability (A):**  
- Buffer overflow can cause crashes or denial of service.  
- Therefore, Availability impact is High (H).

- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:L (0.22)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**  
= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 3.89

**Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged):**  
Impact = 6.42 * [1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - (1 - 0.22) * (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.56)]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.78 * 0.44 * 0.44]  
= 6.42 * [1 - 0.151]  
= 6.42 * 0.849 ≈ 5.45

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability in SourceCodester Facebook News Feed Like 1.0, specifically in the Post Handler component.
- The vulnerability allows "unrestricted upload" via manipulation.
- The attack can be launched remotely.
- Classified as critical.

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- "It is possible to launch the attack remotely."  
- This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.  
- **Value:** Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description mentions "manipulation leads to unrestricted upload," which suggests no special conditions or complex steps are required.  
- No mention of environment or timing constraints.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention any need for authentication or privileges.  
- Since the attack can be launched remotely and leads to unrestricted upload, it likely requires no privileges.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- No mention of needing user interaction (e.g., victim clicking a link).  
- The attacker can launch the attack remotely and directly.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the Post Handler component, presumably within the same security authority.  
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
- **Value:** Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- The vulnerability allows unrestricted upload, which primarily affects integrity and availability.  
- No explicit mention of data disclosure or confidentiality impact.  
- **Value:** None (N)

**Integrity (I):**  
- Unrestricted upload implies the attacker can upload arbitrary files, potentially modifying or injecting malicious content.  
- This impacts integrity.  
- Since the upload is unrestricted, the impact is likely high.  
- **Value:** High (H)

**Availability (A):**  
- Unrestricted upload could lead to denial of service (e.g., filling storage, uploading malicious files).  
- The description does not explicitly mention availability impact, but unrestricted upload often affects availability.  
- Given the critical classification, assume at least Low impact on availability.  
- **Value:** Low (L)

Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**  
- Vulnerability: Origin validation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One security agent.  
- Impact: Allows a local attacker to escalate privileges.  
- Exploitation prerequisite: Attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.  
- Attack vector: Local (since attacker must execute code locally).  
- Privileges required: Low (attacker must have low-privileged code execution).  
- User interaction: Not mentioned, so assume none required.  
- Scope: Privilege escalation usually implies a change in scope (from low privilege to higher privilege).  
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: Since it is a privilege escalation, it likely impacts all three to some degree, but the description does not specify data disclosure or destruction, so assume Low impact on C, I, and A.

---

### Metric Determination:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must execute code locally.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  
  Reason: No special conditions or complexity mentioned beyond having low-privileged code execution.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Attacker must have low-privileged code execution.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  Reason: No user interaction mentioned or implied.

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation implies impact beyond the initial security scope.

- **Confidentiality (C):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation can lead to some confidentiality impact, but no direct data disclosure mentioned.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation can allow modification of system or data.

- **Availability (A):** Low (L)  
  Reason: Privilege escalation could allow disruption, but no direct DoS mentioned.

#####994#####
Let's analyze the CVE description and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics step-by-step.

---

### CVE Description Summary:
- Vulnerability in the Linux kernel's mlxsw driver related to ACL TCAM group handling.
- Stack corruption occurs when more than 16 ACLs are added to a group due to register layout limitations.
- This can cause a kernel panic (stack protector failure).
- The issue arises during the addition of tc filters to a network device.
- The attack vector involves adding filters, which likely requires local access to the system.
- The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (kernel panic).
- No indication of confidentiality or integrity impact.
- The fix limits the ACL group size to prevent stack corruption.

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

#### Attack Vector (AV)
- The vulnerability is triggered by adding tc filters to a net device.
- This is done via netlink messages (kernel syscall interface).
- The attacker must have the ability to send netlink messages to the kernel.
- Netlink is a local IPC mechanism, not accessible remotely over the network.
- Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)**.

#### Attack Complexity (AC)
- The issue requires a rare condition: more than 16 ACLs in a group.
- The description says "in the rare case" and involves specific ordering and priorities.
- This suggests some complexity in triggering the vulnerability.
- Therefore, **High (H)** complexity.

#### Privileges Required (PR)
- To add tc filters, the attacker must have the capability to modify network device filters.
- Typically, this requires **Low (L)** privileges (e.g., CAP_NET_ADMIN).
- So, **Low (L)** privileges required.

#### User Interaction (UI)
- The attack involves sending netlink messages to the kernel.
- No user interaction from another user is required.
- The attacker triggers the vulnerability directly.
- So, **None (N)**.

#### Scope (S)
- The vulnerability causes a kernel panic (stack corruption).
- The impact is within the kernel, but the kernel is a different security authority than user processes.
- Kernel panic affects the entire system, which is outside the scope of the vulnerable component.
- Therefore, **Changed (C)** scope.

#### Confidentiality (C)
- No indication that confidentiality is affected.
- The vulnerability causes a crash, no data leak.
- So, **None (N)**.

#### Integrity (I)
- No indication that data integrity is affected.
- The vulnerability causes a crash, no data modification.
- So, **None (N)**.

#### Availability (A)
- Kernel panic causes denial of service.
- So, **High (H)** availability impact.

### Step 2: Summary of Metric Values

| Metric               | Value | Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Attack Vector (AV)   | L     | Local netlink interface required                |
| Attack Complexity (AC)| H     | Rare condition, complex trigger                 |
| Privileges Required (PR)| L   | Requires CAP_NET_ADMIN or equivalent             |
| User Interaction (UI)| N     | No user interaction required                     |
| Scope (S)            | C     | Kernel panic affects system scope                |
| Confidentiality (C)  | N     | No confidentiality impact                        |
| Integrity (I)        | N     | No integrity impact                              |
| Availability (A)     | H     | Kernel panic causes denial of service            |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formulas or an online calculator with the above values:

- AV:L (0.55)
- AC:H (0.44)
- PR:L (0.62) [Scope Changed]
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:C
- C:N (0.0)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:H (0.56)

**Explaining PR value:**

For Scope Changed (C), PR:L = 0.62 (from CVSS v3.1 specification).

---

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.55 × 0.44 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.127 (approx)  
= approx 1.04

---

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0.56)]  
= 1 - [1 × 1 × 0.44]  
= 1 - 0.44  
= 0.56

Since Scope is Changed (C), Impact Score = 7.52 × (Impact - 0.029)^1.1  
= 7.52 × (0.56 - 0.029)^1.1  
= 7.52 × (0.531)^1.1  
= 7.52 × 0.488 (approx)  
= approx 3.67

---

**Base Score:**

Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))  
= round_up(min(3.67 + 1.04, 10))  
= round_up(4.71)  
= 4.7 (rounded to 4.7)

- PR:N (0.85)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:H (0.56)
- A:H (0.56)

**Exploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI**

= 8.22 * 0.85 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85 ≈ 4.08

**Impact Subscore (Scope Unchanged):**

Impact = 6.42 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A))

= 6.42 * (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.44^3)

= 6.42 * (1 - 0.085)

= 6.42 * 0.915 ≈ 5.87

**Base Score = round_up(min(Impact + Exploitability, 10))**

= round_up(min(5.87 + 4.08, 10)) = round_up(9.95) = 10.0

#####997#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step to determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

**CVE Description Summary:**
- Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected component: Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress, Pricing Table Elementor Widget
- Versions affected: up to 2.10.27
- Cause: insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied link URL
- Attack scenario: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions can inject arbitrary scripts
- Impact: Scripts execute when any user accesses the injected page

---

### Step 1: Determine Base Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The attack is performed by an authenticated user injecting scripts via the plugin interface.  
- The injection happens through the web interface, and the attacker must be logged in.  
- The attack is performed remotely over the network (HTTP request to the WordPress site).  
- Therefore, AV = Network (N)

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, which is straightforward to exploit once authenticated.  
- No special conditions or timing required.  
- Therefore, AC = Low (L)

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The attacker must have contributor-level or above permissions (authenticated user with some privileges).  
- Contributor-level is considered Low privileges in WordPress context (not admin, but can create content).  
- Therefore, PR = Low (L)

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker injects the script, but the script executes when any user views the page.  
- The victim user must visit the injected page for the script to execute.  
- Therefore, UI = Required (R)

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability affects the same security scope (WordPress plugin and site).  
- No privilege escalation beyond the vulnerable component.  
- Therefore, Scope = Unchanged (U)

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Stored XSS can lead to theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users who view the page.  
- This is a partial loss of confidentiality.  
- Therefore, Confidentiality = Low (L)

**Integrity (I):**  
- The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially modifying content or performing actions on behalf of users.  
- This is a partial loss of integrity.  
- Therefore, Integrity = Low (L)

**Availability (A):**  
- The vulnerability does not directly affect availability.  
- Therefore, Availability = None (N)

| Scope (S)            | U     | No scope change                                                                           |
| Confidentiality (C)  | L     | Partial confidentiality impact (data theft possible)                                     |
| Integrity (I)        | L     | Partial integrity impact (script injection/modification)                                 |
| Availability (A)     | N     | No impact on availability                                                                |

#####998#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step:

**CVE Description:**  
"File upload vulnerability in ejinshan v8+ terminal security system allows attackers to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the server."

---

### Step 1: Determine each base metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**  
- The vulnerability allows attackers to upload files to the server.  
- Since the upload happens over a network (likely via a web interface or network service), the attack vector is **Network (N)**.

**Attack Complexity (AC):**  
- The description does not mention any special conditions or complexity to exploit.  
- Uploading arbitrary files usually requires no special conditions if the vulnerability exists.  
- Therefore, **Low (L)**.

**Privileges Required (PR):**  
- The description does not mention that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges.  
- The attacker can upload arbitrary files, implying no privileges required.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**User Interaction (UI):**  
- The attacker uploads files directly; no mention of needing another user to do something.  
- So, **None (N)**.

**Scope (S):**  
- The vulnerability allows uploading files to arbitrary locations on the server.  
- This likely affects resources beyond the vulnerable component itself (e.g., the server OS or other applications).  
- This indicates a **Changed (C)** scope.

**Confidentiality (C):**  
- Uploading arbitrary files can lead to reading or accessing sensitive data if the attacker can place files that allow data exfiltration or code execution.  
- However, the description only mentions upload, not direct data disclosure.  
- Usually, arbitrary file upload can lead to at least some confidentiality impact.  
- Let's assign **Low (L)** confidentiality impact.

**Integrity (I):**  
- Uploading arbitrary files can modify or add files, affecting integrity.  
- This is at least a **High (H)** impact because arbitrary files can replace or add malicious files.

**Availability (A):**  
- Uploading arbitrary files could lead to denial of service (e.g., filling disk space or uploading malicious files that disrupt services).  
- This is likely at least **Low (L)** availability impact.

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the official CVSS v3.1 calculator or formula:

- AV:N (0.85)  
- AC:L (0.77)  
- PR:N (0.85) (Scope Changed)  
- UI:N (0.85)  
- S:C  
- C:L (0.22)  
- I:H (0.56)  
- A:L (0.22)

**Calculations:**

- Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
  = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85  
  ≈ 8.22 × 0.476 ≈ 3.91

- Impact Subscore (Scope Changed):  
  ISC_Base = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
  = 1 - [(1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0.22)]  
  = 1 - [0.78 × 0.44 × 0.78]  
  = 1 - 0.268 ≈ 0.732

- Impact = 7.52 × (ISC_Base - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISC_Base - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × (0.732 - 0.029) - 3.25 × (0.732 - 0.02)^15  
  = 7.52 × 0.703 - 3.25 × (0.712)^15  
  ≈ 5.29 - 3.25 × 0.013  
  ≈ 5.29 - 0.042  
  ≈ 5.25

- Base Score (Scope Changed) =  
  If Impact ≤ 0, then 0 else  
  Roundup(min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10))  
  = Roundup(min(1.08 × (5.25 + 3.91), 10))  
  = Roundup(min(1.08 × 9.16, 10))  
  = Roundup(min(9.89, 10))  
  = 9.9 → rounded up to 10.0 (CVSS rounds up to one decimal place)

  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending crafted requests (CSRF). CSRF attacks typically require the victim to visit a malicious site, but the attacker can be anywhere on the network (internet).  
  **Value:** Network (N)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  CSRF attacks generally require the victim to be authenticated and to visit a malicious site, but the attack itself is straightforward once these conditions are met. No special conditions or timing required.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  The attacker is remote and does not have any privileges on the target system. However, CSRF attacks require the victim to be authenticated (logged in) to perform actions on their behalf. The attacker does not need privileges, but the victim must be logged in.  
  According to CVSS v3.1 guidelines, if the attacker does not need privileges but the victim must be authenticated, PR is None (N).  
  **Value:** None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  The victim must perform some action, such as visiting a malicious website or clicking a link, to trigger the CSRF attack.  
  **Value:** Required (R)

- **Scope (S):**  
  The vulnerability allows unauthorized password resets, which affect the same security authority (user account) within the same application. There is no indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component's security scope.  
  **Value:** Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  The attacker can reset passwords but does not gain direct access to confidential information. However, resetting a password can lead to account takeover, which indirectly affects confidentiality. CVSS guidance suggests that unauthorized password reset impacts confidentiality to a Low degree.  
  **Value:** Low (L)

- **Integrity (I):**  
  The attacker can change the password, which is a modification of data (user credentials). This is a direct impact on integrity.  
  **Value:** High (H)

- **Availability (A):**  
  There is no indication that availability is affected by this vulnerability.  
  **Value:** None (N)

### Step 3: Construct the CVSS v3.1 vector string

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N**

---

# Final answer:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N

#####1000#####
Let's analyze the CVE description step-by-step and determine the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:

---

**CVE Description Summary:**

- Vulnerability: Improper privilege management in the command "show_allsessions".
- Impact: An authenticated attacker can obtain a logged-in administrator’s session information containing cookies.
- Affected products: Zyxel NAS326 and NAS542 firmware versions before specified versions.
- Attacker: Authenticated (implies some privileges).
- Attack vector: Likely local or network? The command is on the device, but is it accessible remotely or only locally?
- User interaction: Not mentioned, likely none.
- Scope: Not mentioned, likely unchanged.
- Impact: Confidentiality is affected (session cookies), integrity and availability not mentioned.

---

### Step 1: Determine each metric

**Attack Vector (AV):**

- The vulnerability is in a command on the device.
- The attacker is authenticated, so they have some access.
- Is the attack performed remotely over the network or locally on the device?

Given that the device is a NAS and the attacker is authenticated, it is likely the attacker can access the device remotely (e.g., via SSH, web interface, or similar). The description does not specify local physical access.

Therefore, **AV:N (Network)** is appropriate.

---

**Attack Complexity (AC):**

- The attacker must be authenticated.
- No mention of any special conditions or complex steps.
- The attacker just needs to run the command "show_allsessions".

This suggests **AC:L (Low)**.

---

**Privileges Required (PR):**

- The attacker must be authenticated.
- The vulnerability is "improper privilege management" in a command that reveals admin session info.
- The attacker is authenticated but is it a low-privilege or high-privilege user?

The description says "an authenticated attacker" can obtain admin session info, implying the attacker does not need to be an admin themselves.

Therefore, the attacker likely has **Low privileges (L)**.

---

**User Interaction (UI):**

- No mention of any user interaction required.
- The attacker runs the command themselves.

Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.

---

**Scope (S):**

- The vulnerability allows access to session information on the same device.
- No indication that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.

Therefore, **S:U (Unchanged)**.

---

**Confidentiality (C):**

- The attacker obtains administrator session information containing cookies.
- This is a clear confidentiality breach.

Given that session cookies can allow full admin access, this is a **High (H)** confidentiality impact.

---

**Integrity (I):**

- No mention of modification of data or commands.
- The attacker only obtains information.

Therefore, **I:N (None)**.

---

**Availability (A):**

- No mention of disruption or denial of service.

Therefore, **A:N (None)**.

---

### Step 2: Summary of metrics

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AV     | N     | Network access likely |
| AC     | L     | No special conditions |
| PR     | L     | Authenticated attacker with low privileges |
| UI     | N     | No user interaction required |
| S      | U     | Scope unchanged |
| C      | H     | Admin session info leaked |
| I      | N     | No integrity impact |
| A      | N     | No availability impact |

### Step 3: Calculate CVSS v3.1 Base Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator formula or an online calculator with the above metrics:

- AV:N (0.85)
- AC:L (0.77)
- PR:L (0.62) (since Scope is Unchanged)
- UI:N (0.85)
- S:U
- C:H (0.56)
- I:N (0.0)
- A:N (0.0)

**Exploitability Subscore:**

Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85  
= 8.22 × 0.85 = 6.987  
6.987 × 0.77 = 5.380  
5.380 × 0.62 = 3.336  
3.336 × 0.85 = 2.836

**Impact Subscore:**

Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]  
= 1 - [(1 - 0.56) × (1 - 0) × (1 - 0)]  
= 1 - [0.44 × 1 × 1]  
= 1 - 0.44 = 0.56

Impact Subscore = 6.42 × Impact  
= 6.42 × 0.56 = 3.595

**Base Score:**

Since Scope is Unchanged:

Base Score = Roundup (Minimum [(Impact + Exploitability), 10])  
= Roundup (3.595 + 2.836)  
= Roundup (6.431)  
= 6.4 (rounded to one decimal place)
