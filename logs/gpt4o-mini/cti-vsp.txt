To analyze the CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we will evaluate each of the base metrics based on the information provided.

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The description indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker, which means the attack vector is Local (L).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description states that an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This implies that there is some complexity involved in the attack, but it does not indicate that it is particularly high. Therefore, we can classify the attack complexity as Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The attacker must have low-privileged access to execute code on the target system. Thus, the privileges required are Low (L).

4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not mention any requirement for user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, we classify user interaction as None (N).

5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation on the same system, and there is no indication that it affects other components or systems. Thus, the scope is Unchanged (U).

6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The description does not indicate any impact on confidentiality, so we classify it as None (N).

7. **Integrity (I)**: Since the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation, it can potentially affect the integrity of the system. However, the description does not specify the extent of this impact. We can classify it as Low (L).

8. **Availability (A)**: The description does not mention any impact on availability, so we classify it as None (N).

Now, summarizing each metric's value:

To analyze the CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we will evaluate each of the base metrics based on the provided information.

### CVE Description Analysis:
- **CVE Description**: An issue was discovered in OpenNDS before 10.1.3. It fails to sanitize the FAS key entry in the configuration file, allowing attackers that have direct or indirect access to this file to execute arbitrary OS commands.

### Base Metrics Evaluation:
1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: 
   - The description indicates that attackers need access to the configuration file, which suggests that the attack is not over the network but requires some form of access. Since it mentions "direct or indirect access," we can classify this as **Local (L)**.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: 
   - The attack does not seem to require any special conditions or complex steps beyond accessing the configuration file. Therefore, we classify this as **Low (L)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: 
   - The description implies that the attacker needs to have access to the configuration file, which suggests that some privileges are required. However, it does not specify that these are high privileges, so we classify this as **Low (L)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI)**: 
   - The attack does not require any user interaction, as it can be executed by the attacker once they have access to the configuration file. Thus, we classify this as **None (N)**.

5. **Scope (S)**:

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: SQL injection vulnerabilities typically have low complexity, as they can often be exploited without any special conditions. Thus, the value is **Low (L)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description does not indicate that any privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning it can be exploited by an unauthenticated user. Therefore, the value is **None (N)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any user interaction, as it can be executed directly by sending a crafted request. Thus, the value is **None (N)**.

5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the application itself and does not cause a change in the scope of the attack (i.e., it does not affect other components or systems). Therefore, the value is **Unchanged (U)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A successful SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, which indicates a high impact on confidentiality. Thus, the value is **High (H)**.

7. **Integrity (I)**: SQL injection can also allow an attacker to modify data, which indicates a high impact on integrity. Therefore, the value is **High (H)**.

8. **Availability (A)**: While SQL injection primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it may not directly impact availability unless the database is compromised in a way that affects service. However, for this analysis, we will assume the impact on availability is **None (N)**.

- **Vulnerability Type**: Improper privilege management
- **Affected Systems**: Zyxel NAS326 and NAS542 firmware versions before specified versions
- **Attack Vector**: The attacker must be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, indicating that the attack is not possible from the network without prior authentication.
- **Impact**: The attacker can obtain session information, which may include sensitive data (cookies).

### Base Metrics Evaluation:
1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: 
   - The attack requires the attacker to be authenticated, which suggests that the attack vector is **Local (L)**.
   
2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: 
   - The description does not indicate any special conditions or complexities involved in exploiting the vulnerability, so we classify it as **Low (L)**.

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: 
   - The attacker must be authenticated, which means they have some level of privileges. Therefore, this is classified as **Low (L)**.

4. **User Interaction (UI)**: 
   - The description does not mention any requirement for user interaction, so this is classified as **None (N)**.

5. **Scope (S)**: 
   - The vulnerability affects the same component (the device itself) and does not change the scope of the attack, so this is classified as **Unchanged (U)**.

6. **Confidentiality (C)**: 
   - The attacker can obtain session information, which likely includes sensitive data (cookies). This indicates a **High (H)** impact on confidentiality.

7. **Integrity (I)**: 
   - There is no indication that the attacker can modify data, so the impact on integrity is classified as **None (N)**.

8. **Availability (A)**: 
   - The description does not suggest any impact on the availability of the system, so this is classified as **None (N)**.

### Summary of Metric Values:
- **AV**: L
- **AC**: L
- **PR**: L
- **UI**: N
- **S**: U
- **C**: H
- **I**: N
- **A**: N

### Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:
Based on the evaluated metrics, the final CVSS v3.1 vector string is:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
```
